        dazzling mine of gems, particularly of sapphires, their blue rays<br>
        crossing with the green of the emerald.  Here and there were opal<br>
        shades of wonderful softness, running through bright spots like<br>
        diamonds of fire, the brilliancy of which the eye could not bear.  The<br>
        power of the lantern seemed increased a hundredfold, like a lamp<br>
        through the lenticular plates of a first-class lighthouse.<br>
        <br>
        "How beautiful! how beautiful!" cried Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," I said, "it is a wonderful sight.  Is it not, Ned?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, confound it!  Yes," answered Ned Land, "it is superb!  I am mad<br>
        at being obliged to admit it.  No one has ever seen anything like it;<br>
        but the sight may cost us dear.  And, if I must say all, I think we are<br>
        seeing here things which God never intended man to see."<br>
        <br>
        Ned was right, it was too beautiful.  Suddenly a cry from Conseil made<br>
        me turn.<br>
        <br>
        "What is it?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Shut your eyes, sir!  Do not look, sir!"  Saying which, Conseil<br>
        clapped his hands over his eyes.<br>
        <br>
        "But what is the matter, my boy?"<br>
        <br>
        "I am dazzled, blinded."<br>
        <br>
        My eyes turned involuntarily towards the glass, but I could not stand<br>
        the fire which seemed to devour them.  I understood what had happened.<br>
        The Nautilus had put on full speed.  All the quiet lustre of the<br>
        ice-walls was at once changed into flashes of lightning.  The fire from<br>
        these myriads of diamonds was blinding.  It required some time to calm<br>
        our troubled looks.  At last the hands were taken down.<br>
        <br>
        "Faith, I should never have believed it," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        It was then five in the morning; and at that moment a shock was felt at<br>
        the bows of the Nautilus.  I knew that its spur had struck a block of<br>
        ice.  It must have been a false manoeuvre, for this submarine tunnel,<br>
        obstructed by blocks, was not very easy navigation.  I thought that<br>
        Captain Nemo, by changing his course, would either turn these obstacles<br>
        or else follow the windings of the tunnel.  In any case, the road<br>
        before us could not be entirely blocked.  But, contrary to my<br>
        expectations, the Nautilus took a decided retrograde motion.<br>
        <br>
        "We are going backwards?" said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," I replied.  "This end of the tunnel can have no egress."<br>
        <br>
        "And then?"<br>
        <br>
        "Then," said I, "the working is easy.  We must go back again, and go<br>
        out at the southern opening.  That is all."<br>
        <br>
        In speaking thus, I wished to appear more confident than I really was.<br>
        But the retrograde motion of the Nautilus was increasing; and,<br>
        reversing the screw, it carried us at great speed.<br>
        <br>
        "It will be a hindrance," said Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "What does it matter, some hours more or less, provided we get out at<br>
        last?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," repeated Ned Land, "provided we do get out at last!"<br>
        <br>
        For a short time I walked from the saloon to the library.  My<br>
        companions were silent.  I soon threw myself on an ottoman, and took a<br>
        book, which my eyes overran mechanically.  A quarter of an hour after,<br>
        Conseil, approaching me, said, "Is what you are reading very<br>
        interesting, sir?"<br>
        <br>
        "Very interesting!"  I replied.<br>
        <br>
        "I should think so, sir.  It is your own book you are reading."<br>
        <br>
        "My book?"<br>
        <br>
        And indeed I was holding in my hand the work on the Great Submarine<br>
        Depths.  I did not even dream of it.  I closed the book and returned to<br>
        my walk.  Ned and Conseil rose to go.<br>
        <br>
        "Stay here, my friends," said I, detaining them.  "Let us remain<br>
        together until we are out of this block."<br>
        <br>
        "As you please, sir," Conseil replied.<br>
        <br>
        Some hours passed.  I often looked at the instruments hanging from the<br>
        partition.  The manometer showed that the Nautilus kept at a constant<br>
        depth of more than three hundred yards; the compass still pointed to<br>
        south; the log indicated a speed of twenty miles an hour, which, in<br>
        such a cramped space, was very great.  But Captain Nemo knew that he<br>
        could not hasten too much, and that minutes were worth ages to us.  At<br>
        twenty-five minutes past eight a second shock took place, this time<br>
        from behind.  I turned pale.  My companions were close by my side.  I<br>
        seized Conseil's hand.  Our looks expressed our feelings better than<br>
        words.  At this moment the Captain entered the saloon.  I went up to<br>
        him.<br>
        <br>
        "Our course is barred southward?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir.  The iceberg has shifted and closed every outlet."<br>
        <br>
        "We are blocked up then?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes."<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XVI<br>
        <br>
        WANT OF AIR<br>
        <br>
        Thus around the Nautilus, above and below, was an impenetrable wall of<br>
        ice.  We were prisoners to the iceberg.  I watched the Captain.  His<br>
        countenance had resumed its habitual imperturbability.<br>
        <br>
        "Gentlemen," he said calmly, "there are two ways of dying in the<br>
        circumstances in which we are placed."  (This puzzling person had the<br>
        air of a mathematical professor lecturing to his pupils.) "The first is<br>
        to be crushed; the second is to die of suffocation.  I do not speak of<br>
        the possibility of dying of hunger, for the supply of provisions in the<br>
        Nautilus will certainly last longer than we shall.  Let us, then,<br>
        calculate our chances."<br>
        <br>
        "As to suffocation, Captain," I replied, "that is not to be feared,<br>
        because our reservoirs are full."<br>
        <br>
        "Just so; but they will only yield two days' supply of air.  Now, for<br>
        thirty-six hours we have been hidden under the water, and already the<br>
        heavy atmosphere of the Nautilus requires renewal.  In forty-eight<br>
        hours our reserve will be exhausted."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Captain, can we be delivered before forty-eight hours?"<br>
        <br>
        "We will attempt it, at least, by piercing the wall that surrounds us."<br>
        <br>
        "On which side?"<br>
        <br>
        "Sound will tell us.  I am going to run the Nautilus aground on the<br>
        lower bank, and my men will attack the iceberg on the side that is<br>
        least thick."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo went out.  Soon I discovered by a hissing noise that the<br>
        water was entering the reservoirs.  The Nautilus sank slowly, and<br>
        rested on the ice at a depth of 350 yards, the depth at which the lower<br>
        bank was immersed.<br>
        <br>
        "My friends," I said, "our situation is serious, but I rely on your<br>
        courage and energy."<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," replied the Canadian, "I am ready to do anything for the general<br>
        safety."<br>
        <br>
        "Good!  Ned," and I held out my hand to the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "I will add," he continued, "that, being as handy with the pickaxe as<br>
        with the harpoon, if I can be useful to the Captain, he can command my<br>
        services."<br>
        <br>
        "He will not refuse your help.  Come, Ned!"<br>
        <br>
        I led him to the room where the crew of the Nautilus were putting on<br>
        their cork-jackets. I told the Captain of Ned's proposal, which he<br>
        accepted.  The Canadian put on his sea-costume, and was ready as soon<br>
        as his companions.  When Ned was dressed, I re-entered the<br>
        drawing-room, where the panes of glass were open, and, posted near<br>
        Conseil, I examined the ambient beds that supported the Nautilus.  Some<br>
        instants after, we saw a dozen of the crew set foot on the bank of ice,<br>
        and among them Ned Land, easily known by his stature.  Captain Nemo was<br>
        with them.  Before proceeding to dig the walls, he took the soundings,<br>
        to be sure of working in the right direction.  Long sounding lines were<br>
        sunk in the side walls, but after fifteen yards they were again stopped<br>
        by the thick wall.  It was useless to attack it on the ceiling-like<br>
        surface, since the iceberg itself measured more than 400 yards in<br>
        height.  Captain Nemo then sounded the lower surface.  There ten yards<br>
        of wall separated us from the water, so great was the thickness of the<br>
        ice-field. It was necessary, therefore, to cut from it a piece equal in<br>
        extent to the waterline of the Nautilus.  There were about 6,000 cubic<br>
        yards to detach, so as to dig a hole by which we could descend to the<br>
        ice-field. The work had begun immediately and carried on with<br>
        indefatigable energy.  Instead of digging round the Nautilus which<br>
        would have involved greater difficulty, Captain Nemo had an immense<br>
        trench made at eight yards from the port-quarter. Then the men set to<br>
        work simultaneously with their screws on several points of its<br>
        circumference.  Presently the pickaxe attacked this compact matter<br>
        vigorously, and large blocks were detached from the mass.  By a curious<br>
        effect of specific gravity, these blocks, lighter than water, fled, so<br>
        to speak, to the vault of the tunnel, that increased in thickness at<br>
        the top in proportion as it diminished at the base.  But that mattered<br>
        little, so long as the lower part grew thinner.  After two hours' hard<br>
        work, Ned Land came in exhausted.  He and his comrades were replaced by<br>
        new workers, whom Conseil and I joined.  The second lieutenant of the<br>
        Nautilus superintended us.  The water seemed singularly cold, but I<br>
        soon got warm handling the pickaxe.  My movements were free enough,<br>
        although they were made under a pressure of thirty atmospheres.  When I<br>
        re-entered, after working two hours, to take some food and rest, I<br>
        found a perceptible difference between the pure fluid with which the<br>
        Rouquayrol engine supplied me and the atmosphere of the Nautilus,<br>
        already charged with carbonic acid.  The air had not been renewed for<br>
        forty-eight hours, and its vivifying qualities were considerably<br>
        enfeebled.  However, after a lapse of twelve hours, we had only raised<br>
        a block of ice one yard thick, on the marked surface, which was about<br>
        600 cubic yards!  Reckoning that it took twelve hours to accomplish<br>
        this much it would take five nights and four days to bring this<br>
        enterprise to a satisfactory conclusion.  Five nights and four days!<br>
        And we have only air enough for two days in the reservoirs!  "Without<br>
        taking into account," said Ned, "that, even if we get out of this<br>
        infernal prison, we shall also be imprisoned under the iceberg, shut<br>
        out from all possible communication with the atmosphere." True enough!<br>
        Who could then foresee the minimum of time necessary for our<br>
        deliverance?  We might be suffocated before the Nautilus could regain<br>
        the surface of the waves?  Was it destined to perish in this ice-tomb,<br>
        with all those it enclosed?  The situation was terrible.  But everyone<br>
        had looked the danger in the face, and each was determined to do his<br>
        duty to the last.<br>
        <br>
        As I expected, during the night a new block a yard square was carried<br>
        away, and still further sank the immense hollow.  But in the morning<br>
        when, dressed in my cork-jacket, I traversed the slushy mass at a<br>
        temperature of six or seven degrees below zero, I remarked that the<br>
        side walls were gradually closing in.  The beds of water farthest from<br>
        the trench, that were not warmed by the men's work, showed a tendency<br>
        to solidification.  In presence of this new and imminent danger, what<br>
        would become of our chances of safety, and how hinder the<br>
        solidification of this liquid medium, that would burst the partitions<br>
        of the Nautilus like glass?<br>
        <br>
        I did not tell my companions of this new danger.  What was the good of<br>
        damping the energy they displayed in the painful work of escape?  But<br>
        when I went on board again, I told Captain Nemo of this grave<br>
        complication.<br>
        <br>
        "I know it," he said, in that calm tone which could counteract the most<br>
        terrible apprehensions.  "It is one danger more; but I see no way of<br>
        escaping it; the only chance of safety is to go quicker than<br>
        solidification.  We must be beforehand with it, that is all."<br>
        <br>
        On this day for several hours I used my pickaxe vigorously.  The work<br>
        kept me up.  Besides, to work was to quit the Nautilus, and breathe<br>
        directly the pure air drawn from the reservoirs, and supplied by our<br>
        apparatus, and to quit the impoverished and vitiated atmosphere.<br>
        Towards evening the trench was dug one yard deeper.  When I returned on<br>
        board, I was nearly suffocated by the carbonic acid with which the air<br>
        was filled--ah! if we had only the chemical means to drive away this<br>
        deleterious gas.  We had plenty of oxygen; all this water contained a<br>
        considerable quantity, and by dissolving it with our powerful piles, it<br>
        would restore the vivifying fluid.  I had thought well over it; but of<br>
        what good was that, since the carbonic acid produced by our respiration<br>
        had invaded every part of the vessel?  To absorb it, it was necessary<br>
        to fill some jars with caustic potash, and to shake them incessantly.<br>
        Now this substance was wanting on board, and nothing could replace it.<br>
        On that evening, Captain Nemo ought to open the taps of his reservoirs,<br>
        and let some pure air into the interior of the Nautilus; without this<br>
        precaution we could not get rid of the sense of suffocation.  The next<br>
        day, March 26th, I resumed my miner's work in beginning the fifth yard.<br>
        The side walls and the lower surface of the iceberg thickened visibly.<br>
        It was evident that they would meet before the Nautilus was able to<br>
        disengage itself.  Despair seized me for an instant; my pickaxe nearly<br>
        fell from my hands.  What was the good of digging if I must be<br>
        suffocated, crushed by the water that was turning into stone?--a<br>
        punishment that the ferocity of the savages even would not have<br>
        invented!  Just then Captain Nemo passed near me.  I touched his hand<br>
        and showed him the walls of our prison.  The wall to port had advanced<br>
        to at least four yards from the hull of the Nautilus.  The Captain<br>
        understood me, and signed me to follow him.  We went on board.  I took<br>
        off my cork-jacket and accompanied him into the drawing-room.<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax, we must attempt some desperate means, or we shall be<br>
        sealed up in this solidified water as in cement."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes; but what is to be done?"<br>
        <br>
        "Ah! if my Nautilus were strong enough to bear this pressure without<br>
        being crushed!"<br>
        <br>
        "Well?"  I asked, not catching the Captain's idea.<br>
        <br>
        "Do you not understand," he replied, "that this congelation of water<br>
        will help us?  Do you not see that by its solidification, it would<br>
        burst through this field of ice that imprisons us, as, when it freezes,<br>
        it bursts the hardest stones?  Do you not perceive that it would be an<br>
        agent of safety instead of destruction?"<br>
        <a href=../site2/page2_2473.html>external_link0_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Captain, perhaps.  But, whatever resistance to crushing the<br>
        Nautilus possesses, it could not support this terrible pressure, and<br>
        would be flattened like an iron plate."<br>
        <br>
        "I know it, sir.  Therefore we must not reckon on the aid of nature,<br>
        but on our own exertions.  We must stop this solidification.  Not only<br>
        will the side walls be pressed together; but there is not ten feet of<br>
        water before or behind the Nautilus.  The congelation gains on us on<br>
        all sides."<br>
        <br>
        "How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on<br>
        board?"<br>
        <br>
        The Captain looked in my face.  "After to-morrow they will be empty!"<br>
        <br>
        A cold sweat came over me.  However, ought I to have been astonished at<br>
        the answer?  On March 22, the Nautilus was in the open polar seas.  We<br>
        were at 26°. For five days we had lived on the reserve on board.<br>
        And what was left of the respirable air must be kept for the workers.<br>
        Even now, as I write, my recollection is still so vivid that an<br>
        involuntary terror seizes me and my lungs seem to be without air.<br>
        Meanwhile, Captain Nemo reflected silently, and evidently an idea had<br>
        struck him; but he seemed to reject it.  At last, these words escaped<br>
        his lips:<br>
        <br>
        "Boiling water!" he muttered.<br>
        <br>
        "Boiling water?"  I cried.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir.  We are enclosed in a space that is relatively confined.<br>
        Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps,<br>
        raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?"<br>
        <br>
        "Let us try it," I said resolutely.<br>
        <br>
        "Let us try it, Professor."<br>
        <br>
        The thermometer then stood at 7° outside.  Captain Nemo took me to<br>
        the galleys, where the vast distillatory machines stood that furnished<br>
        the drinkable water by evaporation.  They filled these with water, and<br>
        all the electric heat from the piles was thrown through the worms<br>
        bathed in the liquid.  In a few minutes this water reached 100°. It<br>
        was directed towards the pumps, while fresh water replaced it in<br>
        proportion.  The heat developed by the troughs was such that cold<br>
        water, drawn up from the sea after only having gone through the<br>
        machines, came boiling into the body of the pump.  The injection was<br>
        begun, and three hours after the thermometer marked 6° below zero<br>
        outside.  One degree was gained.  Two hours later the thermometer only<br>
        marked 4°.<br>
        <br>
        "We shall succeed," I said to the Captain, after having anxiously<br>
        watched the result of the operation.<br>
        <br>
        "I think," he answered, "that we shall not be crushed.  We have no more<br>
        suffocation to fear."<br>
        <br>
        During the night the temperature of the water rose to 1° below<br>
        zero.  The injections could not carry it to a higher point.  But, as<br>
        the congelation of the sea-water produces at least 2°, I was at<br>
        least reassured against the dangers of solidification.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, March 27th, six yards of ice had been cleared, twelve<br>
        feet only remaining to be cleared away.  There was yet forty-eight<br>
        hours' work.  The air could not be renewed in the interior of the<br>
        Nautilus.  And this day would make it worse.  An intolerable weight<br>
        oppressed me.  Towards three o'clock in the evening this feeling rose<br>
        to a violent degree.  Yawns dislocated my jaws.  My lungs panted as<br>
        they inhaled this burning fluid, which became rarefied more and more.<br>
        A moral torpor took hold of me.  I was powerless, almost unconscious.<br>
        My brave Conseil, though exhibiting the same symptoms and suffering in<br>
        the same manner, never left me.  He took my hand and encouraged me, and<br>
        I heard him murmur, "Oh! if I could only not breathe, so as to leave<br>
        more air for my master!"<br>
        <br>
        Tears came into my eyes on hearing him speak thus.  If our situation to<br>
        all was intolerable in the interior, with what haste and gladness would<br>
        we put on our cork-jackets to work in our turn!  Pickaxes sounded on<br>
        the frozen ice-beds. Our arms ached, the skin was torn off our hands.<br>
        But what were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter?  Vital air<br>
        came to the lungs!  We breathed! we breathed!<br>
        <br>
        All this time no one prolonged his voluntary task beyond the prescribed<br>
        time.  His task accomplished, each one handed in turn to his panting<br>
        companions the apparatus that supplied him with life.  Captain Nemo set<br>
        the example, and submitted first to this severe discipline.  When the<br>
        time came, he gave up his apparatus to another and returned to the<br>
        vitiated air on board, calm, unflinching, unmurmuring.<br>
        <br>
        On that day the ordinary work was accomplished with unusual vigour.<br>
        Only two yards remained to be raised from the surface.  Two yards only<br>
        separated us from the open sea.  But the reservoirs were nearly emptied<br>
        of air.  The little that remained ought to be kept for the workers; not<br>
        a particle for the Nautilus.  When I went back on board, I was half<br>
        suffocated.  What a night!  I know not how to describe it.  The next<br>
        day my breathing was oppressed.  Dizziness accompanied the pain in my<br>
        head and made me like a drunken man.  My companions showed the same<br>
        symptoms.  Some of the crew had rattling in the throat.<br>
        <br>
        On that day, the sixth of our imprisonment, Captain Nemo, finding the<br>
        pickaxes work too slowly, resolved to crush the ice-bed that still<br>
        separated us from the liquid sheet.  This man's coolness and energy<br>
        never forsook him.  He subdued his physical pains by moral force.<br>
        <br>
        By his orders the vessel was lightened, that is to say, raised from the<br>
        ice-bed by a change of specific gravity.  When it floated they towed it<br>
        so as to bring it above the immense trench made on the level of the<br>
        water-line. Then, filling his reservoirs of water, he descended and<br>
        shut himself up in the hole.<br>
        <br>
        Just then all the crew came on board, and the double door of<br>
        communication was shut.  The Nautilus then rested on the bed of ice,<br>
        which was not one yard thick, and which the sounding leads had<br>
        perforated in a thousand places.  The taps of the reservoirs were then<br>
        opened, and a hundred cubic yards of water was let in, increasing the<br>
        weight of the Nautilus to 1,800 tons.  We waited, we listened,<br>
        forgetting our sufferings in hope.  Our safety depended on this last<br>
        chance.  Notwithstanding the buzzing in my head, I soon heard the<br>
        humming sound under the hull of the Nautilus.  The ice cracked with a<br>
        singular noise, like tearing paper, and the Nautilus sank.<br>
        <br>
        "We are off!" murmured Conseil in my ear.<br>
        <br>
        I could not answer him.  I seized his hand, and pressed it<br>
        convulsively.  All at once, carried away by its frightful overcharge,<br>
        the Nautilus sank like a bullet under the waters, that is to say, it<br>
        fell as if it was in a vacuum.  Then all the electric force was put on<br>
        the pumps, that soon began to let the water out of the reservoirs.<br>
        After some minutes, our fall was stopped.  Soon, too, the manometer<br>
        indicated an ascending movement.  The screw, going at full speed, made<br>
        the iron hull tremble to its very bolts and drew us towards the north.<br>
        But if this floating under the iceberg is to last another day before we<br>
        reach the open sea, I shall be dead first.<br>
        <br>
        Half stretched upon a divan in the library, I was suffocating.  My face<br>
        was purple, my lips blue, my faculties suspended.  I neither saw nor<br>
        heard.  All notion of time had gone from my mind.  My muscles could not<br>
        contract.  I do not know how many hours passed thus, but I was<br>
        conscious of the agony that was coming over me.  I felt as if I was<br>
        going to die.  Suddenly I came to.  Some breaths of air penetrated my<br>
        lungs.  Had we risen to the surface of the waves?  Were we free of the<br>
        iceberg?  No!  Ned and Conseil, my two brave friends, were sacrificing<br>
        themselves to save me.  Some particles of air still remained at the<br>
        bottom of one apparatus.  Instead of using it, they had kept it for me,<br>
        and, while they were being suffocated, they gave me life, drop by drop.<br>
        I wanted to push back the thing; they held my hands, and for some<br>
        moments I breathed freely.  I looked at the clock; it was eleven in the<br>
        morning.  It ought to be the 28th of March.  The Nautilus went at a<br>
        frightful pace, forty miles an hour.  It literally tore through the<br>
        water.  Where was Captain Nemo?  Had he succumbed?  Were his companions<br>
        dead with him?  At the moment the manometer indicated that we were not<br>
        more than twenty feet from the surface.  A mere plate of ice separated<br>
        us from the atmosphere.  Could we not break it?  Perhaps.  In any case<br>
        the Nautilus was going to attempt it.  I felt that it was in an oblique<br>
        position, lowering the stern, and raising the bows.  The introduction<br>
        of water had been the means of disturbing its equilibrium.  Then,<br>
        impelled by its powerful screw, it attacked the ice-field from beneath<br>
        like a formidable battering-ram.  It broke it by backing and then<br>
        rushing forward against the field, which gradually gave way; and at<br>
        last, dashing suddenly against it, shot forwards on the ice-field, that<br>
        crushed beneath its weight.  The panel was opened--one might say torn<br>
        off--and the pure air came in in abundance to all parts of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XVII<br>
        <br>
        FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON<br>
        <br>
        How I got on to the platform, I have no idea; perhaps the Canadian had<br>
        carried me there.  But I breathed, I inhaled the vivifying sea-air.  My<br>
        two companions were getting drunk with the fresh particles.  The other<br>
        unhappy men had been so long without food, that they could not with<br>
        impunity indulge in the simplest aliments that were given them.  We, on<br>
        the contrary, had no end to restrain ourselves; we could draw this air<br>
        freely into our lungs, and it was the breeze, the breeze alone, that<br>
        filled us with this keen enjoyment.<br>
        <br>
        "Ah!" said Conseil, "how delightful this oxygen is!  Master need not<br>
        fear to breathe it.  There is enough for everybody."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land did not speak, but he opened his jaws wide enough to frighten<br>
        a shark.  Our strength soon returned, and, when I looked round me, I<br>
        saw we were alone on the platform.  The foreign seamen in the Nautilus<br>
        were contented with the air that circulated in the interior; none of<br>
        them had come to drink in the open air.<br>
        <br>
        The first words I spoke were words of gratitude and thankfulness to my<br>
        two companions.  Ned and Conseil had prolonged my life during the last<br>
        hours of this long agony.  All my gratitude could not repay such<br>
        devotion.<br>
        <br>
        "My friends," said I, "we are bound one to the other for ever, and I am<br>
        under infinite obligations to you."<br>
        <br>
        "Which I shall take advantage of," exclaimed the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "What do you mean?" said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "I mean that I shall take you with me when I leave this infernal<br>
        Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        "Well," said Conseil, "after all this, are we going right?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," I replied, "for we are going the way of the sun, and here the<br>
        sun is in the north."<br>
        <br>
        "No doubt," said Ned Land; "but it remains to be seen whether he will<br>
        bring the ship into the Pacific or the Atlantic Ocean, that is, into<br>
        frequented or deserted seas."<br>
        <br>
        I could not answer that question, and I feared that Captain Nemo would<br>
        rather take us to the vast ocean that touches the coasts of Asia and<br>
        America at the same time.  He would thus complete the tour round the<br>
        submarine world, and return to those waters in which the Nautilus could<br>
        sail freely.  We ought, before long, to settle this important point.<br>
        The Nautilus went at a rapid pace.  The polar circle was soon passed,<br>
        and the course shaped for Cape Horn.  We were off the American point,<br>
        March 31st, at seven o'clock in the evening.  Then all our past<br>
        sufferings were forgotten.  The remembrance of that imprisonment in the<br>
        ice was effaced from our minds.  We only thought of the future.<br>
        Captain Nemo did not appear again either in the drawing-room or on the<br>
        platform.  The point shown each day on the planisphere, and, marked by<br>
        the lieutenant, showed me the exact direction of the Nautilus.  Now, on<br>
        that evening, it was evident, to, my great satisfaction, that we were<br>
        going back to the North by the Atlantic.  The next day, April 1st, when<br>
        the Nautilus ascended to the surface some minutes before noon, we<br>
        sighted land to the west.  It was Terra del Fuego, which the first<br>
        navigators named thus from seeing the quantity of smoke that rose from<br>
        the natives' huts.  The coast seemed low to me, but in the distance<br>
        rose high mountains.  I even thought I had a glimpse of Mount<br>
        Sarmiento, that rises 2,070 yards above the level of the sea, with a<br>
        very pointed summit, which, according as it is misty or clear, is a<br>
        sign of fine or of wet weather.  At this moment the peak was clearly<br>
        defined against the sky.  The Nautilus, diving again under the water,<br>
        approached the coast, which was only some few miles off.  From the<br>
        glass windows in the drawing-room, I saw long seaweeds and gigantic<br>
        fuci and varech, of which the open polar sea contains so many<br>
        specimens, with their sharp polished filaments; they measured about 300<br>
        yards in length--real cables, thicker than one's thumb; and, having<br>
        great tenacity, they are often used as ropes for vessels.  Another weed<br>
        known as velp, with leaves four feet long, buried in the coral<br>
        concretions, hung at the bottom.  It served as nest and food for<br>
        myriads of crustacea and molluscs, crabs, and cuttlefish.  There seals<br>
        and otters had splendid repasts, eating the flesh of fish with<br>
        sea-vegetables, according to the English fashion.  Over this fertile<br>
        and luxuriant ground the Nautilus passed with great rapidity.  Towards<br>
        evening it approached the Falkland group, the rough summits of which I<br>
        recognised the following day.  The depth of the sea was moderate.  On<br>
        the shores our nets brought in beautiful specimens of sea weed, and<br>
        particularly a certain fucus, the roots of which were filled with the<br>
        best mussels in the world.  Geese and ducks fell by dozens on the<br>
        platform, and soon took their places in the pantry on board.<br>
        <br>
        When the last heights of the Falklands had disappeared from the<br>
        horizon, the Nautilus sank to between twenty and twenty-five yards, and<br>
        followed the American coast.  Captain Nemo did not show himself.  Until<br>
        the 3rd of April we did not quit the shores of Patagonia, sometimes<br>
        under the ocean, sometimes at the surface.  The Nautilus passed beyond<br>
        the large estuary formed by the Uraguay.  Its direction was northwards,<br>
        and followed the long windings of the coast of South America.  We had<br>
        then made 1,600 miles since our embarkation in the seas of Japan.<br>
        About eleven o'clock in the morning the Tropic of Capricorn was crossed<br>
        on the thirty-seventh meridian, and we passed Cape Frio standing out to<br>
        sea.  Captain Nemo, to Ned Land's great displeasure, did not like the<br>
        neighbourhood of the inhabited coasts of Brazil, for we went at a giddy<br>
        speed.  Not a fish, not a bird of the swiftest kind could follow us,<br>
        and the natural curiosities of these seas escaped all observation.<br>
        <br>
        This speed was kept up for several days, and in the evening of the 9th<br>
        of April we sighted the most westerly point of South America that forms<br>
        Cape San Roque.  But then the Nautilus swerved again, and sought the<br>
        lowest depth of a submarine valley which is between this Cape and<br>
        Sierra Leone on the African coast.  This valley bifurcates to the<br>
        parallel of the Antilles, and terminates at the mouth by the enormous<br>
        depression of 9,000 yards.  In this place, the geological basin of the<br>
        ocean forms, as far as the Lesser Antilles, a cliff to three and a half<br>
        miles perpendicular in height, and, at the parallel of the Cape Verde<br>
        Islands, an other wall not less considerable, that encloses thus all<br>
        the sunk continent of the Atlantic.  The bottom of this immense valley<br>
        is dotted with some mountains, that give to these submarine places a<br>
        picturesque aspect.  I speak, moreover, from the manuscript charts that<br>
        were in the library of the Nautilus--charts evidently due to Captain<br>
        <a href=../site0/page0_6556.html>external_link1_text</a><br><br>
        Nemo's hand, and made after his personal observations.  For two days<br>
        the desert and deep waters were visited by means of the inclined<br>
        planes.  The Nautilus was furnished with long diagonal broadsides which<br>
        carried it to all elevations.  But on the 11th of April it rose<br>
        suddenly, and land appeared at the mouth of the Amazon River, a vast<br>
        estuary, the embouchure of which is so considerable that it freshens<br>
        the sea-water for the distance of several leagues.<br>
        <br>
        The equator was crossed. Twenty miles to the west were the Guianas, a<br>
        French territory, on which we could have found an easy refuge; but a<br>
        stiff breeze was blowing, and the furious waves would not have allowed<br>
        a single boat to face them. Ned Land understood that, no doubt, for he<br>
        spoke not a word about it. For my part, I made no allusion to his<br>
        schemes of flight, for I would not urge him to make an attempt that<br>
        must inevitably fail. I made the time pass pleasantly by interesting<br>
        studies.  During the days of April 11th and 12th, the Nautilus did not<br>
        leave the surface of the sea, and the net brought in a marvellous haul<br>
        of Zoophytes, fish and reptiles. Some zoophytes had been fished up by<br>
        the chain of the nets; they were for the most part beautiful<br>
        phyctallines, belonging to the actinidian family, and among other<br>
        species the phyctalis protexta, peculiar to that part of the ocean,<br>
        with a little cylindrical trunk, ornamented With vertical lines,<br>
        speckled with red dots, crowning a marvellous blossoming of tentacles.<br>
        As to the molluscs, they consisted of some I had already<br>
        observed--turritellas, olive porphyras, with regular lines<br>
        intercrossed, with red spots standing out plainly against the flesh;<br>
        odd pteroceras, like petrified scorpions; translucid hyaleas,<br>
        argonauts, cuttle-fish (excellent eating), and certain species of<br>
        calmars that naturalists of antiquity have classed amongst the<br>
        flying-fish, and that serve principally for bait for cod-fishing. I had<br>
        now an opportunity of studying several species of fish on these shores.<br>
        Amongst the cartilaginous ones, petromyzons-pricka, a sort of eel,<br>
        fifteen inches long, with a greenish head, violet fins, grey-blue back,<br>
        brown belly, silvered and sown with bright spots, the pupil of the eye<br>
        encircled with gold--a curious animal, that the current of the Amazon<br>
        had drawn to the sea, for they inhabit fresh waters--tuberculated<br>
        streaks, with pointed snouts, and a long loose tail, armed with a long<br>
        jagged sting; little sharks, a yard long, grey and whitish skin, and<br>
        several rows of teeth, bent back, that are generally known by the name<br>
        of pantouffles; vespertilios, a kind of red isosceles triangle, half a<br>
        yard long, to which pectorals are attached by fleshy prolongations that<br>
        make them look like bats, but that their horny appendage, situated near<br>
        the nostrils, has given them the name of sea-unicorns; lastly, some<br>
        species of balistae, the curassavian, whose spots were of a brilliant<br>
        gold colour, and the capriscus of clear violet, and with varying shades<br>
        like a pigeon's throat.<br>
        <br>
        I end here this catalogue, which is somewhat dry perhaps, but very<br>
        exact, with a series of bony fish that I observed in passing belonging<br>
        to the apteronotes, and whose snout is white as snow, the body of a<br>
        beautiful black, marked with a very long loose fleshy strip;<br>
        odontognathes, armed with spikes; sardines nine inches long, glittering<br>
        with a bright silver light; a species of mackerel provided with two<br>
        anal fins; centronotes of a blackish tint, that are fished for with<br>
        torches, long fish, two yards in length, with fat flesh, white and<br>
        firm, which, when they arc fresh, taste like eel, and when dry, like<br>
        smoked salmon; labres, half red, covered with scales only at the bottom<br>
        of the dorsal and anal fins; chrysoptera, on which gold and silver<br>
        blend their brightness with that of the ruby and topaz; golden-tailed<br>
        spares, the flesh of which is extremely delicate, and whose<br>
        phosphorescent properties betray them in the midst of the waters;<br>
        orange-coloured spares with long tongues; maigres, with gold caudal<br>
        fins, dark thorn-tails, anableps of Surinam, etc.<br>
        <br>
        Notwithstanding this "et cetera," I must not omit to mention fish that<br>
        Conseil will long remember, and with good reason. One of our nets had<br>
        hauled up a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off,<br>
        formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces. It was white<br>
        underneath, red above, with large round spots of dark blue encircled<br>
        with black, very glossy skin, terminating in a bilobed fin. Laid out on<br>
        the platform, it struggled, tried to turn itself by convulsive<br>
        movements, and made so many efforts, that one last turn had nearly sent<br>
        it into the sea. But Conseil, not wishing to let the fish go, rushed to<br>
        it, and, before I could prevent him, had seized it with both hands. In<br>
        a moment he was overthrown, his legs in the air, and half his body<br>
        paralysed, crying--<br>
        <br>
        "Oh! master, master! help me!"<br>
        <br>
        It was the first time the poor boy had spoken to me so familiarly.  The<br>
        Canadian and I took him up, and rubbed his contracted arms till he<br>
        became sensible. The unfortunate Conseil had attacked a cramp-fish of<br>
        the most dangerous kind, the cumana. This odd animal, in a medium<br>
        conductor like water, strikes fish at several yards' distance, so great<br>
        is the power of its electric organ, the two principal surfaces of which<br>
        do not measure less than twenty-seven square feet. The next day, April<br>
        12th, the Nautilus approached the Dutch coast, near the mouth of the<br>
        Maroni. There several groups of sea-cows herded together; they were<br>
        manatees, that, like the dugong and the stellera, belong to the skenian<br>
        order. These beautiful animals, peaceable and inoffensive, from<br>
        eighteen to twenty-one feet in length, weigh at least sixteen<br>
        hundredweight. I told Ned Land and Conseil that provident nature had<br>
        assigned an important role to these mammalia. Indeed, they, like the<br>
        seals, are designed to graze on the submarine prairies, and thus<br>
        destroy the accumulation of weed that obstructs the tropical rivers.<br>
        <br>
        "And do you know," I added, "what has been the result since men have<br>
        almost entirely annihilated this useful race? That the putrefied weeds<br>
        have poisoned the air, and the poisoned air causes the yellow fever,<br>
        that desolates these beautiful countries. Enormous vegetations are<br>
        multiplied under the torrid seas, and the evil is irresistibly<br>
        developed from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata to Florida. If we are<br>
        to believe Toussenel, this plague is nothing to what it would be if the<br>
        seas were cleaned of whales and seals. Then, infested with poulps,<br>
        medusae, and cuttle-fish, they would become immense centres of<br>
        infection, since their waves would not possess 'these vast stomachs<br>
        that God had charged to infest the surface of the seas.'"<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XVIII<br>
        <br>
        THE POULPS<br>
        <br>
        For several days the Nautilus kept off from the American coast.<br>
        Evidently it did not wish to risk the tides of the Gulf of Mexico or of<br>
        the sea of the Antilles.  April 16th, we sighted Martinique and<br>
        Guadaloupe from a distance of about thirty miles.  I saw their tall<br>
        peaks for an instant.  The Canadian, who counted on carrying out his<br>
        projects in the Gulf, by either landing or hailing one of the numerous<br>
        boats that coast from one island to another, was quite disheartened.<br>
        Flight would have been quite practicable, if Ned Land had been able to<br>
        take possession of the boat without the Captain's knowledge.  But in<br>
        the open sea it could not be thought of.  The Canadian, Conseil, and I<br>
        had a long conversation on this subject.  For six months we had been<br>
        prisoners on board the Nautilus.  We had travelled 17,000 leagues; and,<br>
        as Ned Land said, there was no reason why it should come to an end.  We<br>
        could hope nothing from the Captain of the Nautilus, but only from<br>
        ourselves.  Besides, for some time past he had become graver, more<br>
        retired, less sociable.  He seemed to shun me.  I met him rarely.<br>
        Formerly he was pleased to explain the submarine marvels to me; now he<br>
        left me to my studies, and came no more to the saloon.  What change had<br>
        come over him?  For what cause?  For my part, I did not wish to bury<br>
        with me my curious and novel studies.  I had now the power to write the<br>
        true book of the sea; and this book, sooner or later, I wished to see<br>
        daylight.  The land nearest us was the archipelago of the Bahamas.<br>
        There rose high submarine cliffs covered with large weeds.  It was<br>
        about eleven o'clock when Ned Land drew my attention to a formidable<br>
        pricking, like the sting of an ant, which was produced by means of<br>
        large seaweeds.<br>
        <br>
        "Well," I said, "these are proper caverns for poulps, and I should not<br>
        be astonished to see some of these monsters."<br>
        <br>
        "What!" said Conseil; "cuttlefish, real cuttlefish of the cephalopod<br>
        class?"<br>
        <br>
        "No," I said, "poulps of huge dimensions."<br>
        <br>
        "I will never believe that such animals exist," said Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "Well," said Conseil, with the most serious air in the world, "I<br>
        remember perfectly to have seen a large vessel drawn under the waves by<br>
        an octopus's arm."<br>
        <br>
        "You saw that?" said the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "With your own eyes?"<br>
        <br>
        "With my own eyes."<br>
        <br>
        "Where, pray, might that be?"<br>
        <br>
        "At St. Malo," answered Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "In the port?" said Ned, ironically.<br>
        <br>
        "No; in a church," replied Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "In a church!" cried the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes; friend Ned.  In a picture representing the poulp in question."<br>
        <br>
        "Good!" said Ned Land, bursting out laughing.<br>
        <br>
        "He is quite right," I said.  "I have heard of this picture; but the<br>
        subject represented is taken from a legend, and you know what to think<br>
        of legends in the matter of natural history.  Besides, when it is a<br>
        question of monsters, the imagination is apt to run wild.  Not only is<br>
        it supposed that these poulps can draw down vessels, but a certain<br>
        Olaus Magnus speaks of an octopus a mile long that is more like an<br>
        island than an animal.  It is also said that the Bishop of Nidros was<br>
        building an altar on an immense rock.  Mass finished, the rock began to<br>
        walk, and returned to the sea.  The rock was a poulp.  Another Bishop,<br>
        Pontoppidan, speaks also of a poulp on which a regiment of cavalry<br>
        could manoeuvre.  Lastly, the ancient naturalists speak of monsters<br>
        whose mouths were like gulfs, and which were too large to pass through<br>
        the Straits of Gibraltar."<br>
        <br>
        "But how much is true of these stories?" asked Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Nothing, my friends; at least of that which passes the limit of truth<br>
        to get to fable or legend.  Nevertheless, there must be some ground for<br>
        the imagination of the story-tellers. One cannot deny that poulps and<br>
        cuttlefish exist of a large species, inferior, however, to the<br>
        cetaceans.  Aristotle has stated the dimensions of a cuttlefish as five<br>
        cubits, or nine feet two inches.  Our fishermen frequently see some<br>
        that are more than four feet long.  Some skeletons of poulps are<br>
        preserved in the museums of Trieste and Montpelier, that measure two<br>
        yards in length.  Besides, according to the calculations of some<br>
        naturalists, one of these animals only six feet long would have<br>
        tentacles twenty-seven feet long.  That would suffice to make a<br>
        formidable monster."<br>
        <br>
        "Do they fish for them in these days?" asked Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "If they do not fish for them, sailors see them at least.  One of my<br>
        friends, Captain Paul Bos of Havre, has often affirmed that he met one<br>
        of these monsters of colossal dimensions in the Indian seas.  But the<br>
        most astonishing fact, and which does not permit of the denial of the<br>
        existence of these gigantic animals, happened some years ago, in 1861."<br>
        <br>
        "What is the fact?" asked Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        "This is it.  In 1861, to the north-east of Teneriffe, very nearly in<br>
        the same latitude we are in now, the crew of the despatch-boat Alector<br>
        perceived a monstrous cuttlefish swimming in the waters.  Captain<br>
        Bouguer went near to the animal, and attacked it with harpoon and guns,<br>
        without much success, for balls and harpoons glided over the soft<br>
        flesh.  After several fruitless attempts the crew tried to pass a<br>
        slip-knot round the body of the mollusc.  The noose slipped as far as<br>
        the tail fins and there stopped.  They tried then to haul it on board,<br>
        but its weight was so considerable that the tightness of the cord<br>
        separated the tail from the body, and, deprived of this ornament, he<br>
        disappeared under the water."<br>
        <br>
        "Indeed! is that a fact?"<br>
        <br>
        "An indisputable fact, my good Ned.  They proposed to name this poulp<br>
        `Bouguer's cuttlefish.'"<br>
        <br>
        "What length was it?" asked the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Did it not measure about six yards?" said Conseil, who, posted at the<br>
        window, was examining again the irregular windings of the cliff.<br>
        <br>
        "Precisely," I replied.<br>
        <br>
        "Its head," rejoined Conseil, "was it not crowned with eight tentacles,<br>
        that beat the water like a nest of serpents?"<br>
        <br>
        "Precisely."<br>
        <br>
        "Had not its eyes, placed at the back of its head, considerable<br>
        development?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Conseil."<br>
        <br>
        "And was not its mouth like a parrot's beak?"<br>
        <br>
        "Exactly, Conseil."<br>
        <br>
        "Very well! no offence to master," he replied, quietly; "if this is not<br>
        Bouguer's cuttlefish, it is, at least, one of its brothers."<br>
        <br>
        I looked at Conseil.  Ned Land hurried to the window.<br>
        <br>
        "What a horrible beast!" he cried.<br>
        <br>
        I looked in my turn, and could not repress a gesture of disgust.<br>
        Before my eyes was a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends<br>
        of the marvellous.  It was an immense cuttlefish, being eight yards<br>
        long.  It swam crossways in the direction of the Nautilus with great<br>
        speed, watching us with its enormous staring green eyes.  Its eight<br>
        arms, or rather feet, fixed to its head, that have given the name of<br>
        cephalopod to these animals, were twice as long as its body, and were<br>
        twisted like the furies' hair.  One could see the 250 air holes on the<br>
        inner side of the tentacles.  The monster's mouth, a horned beak like a<br>
        parrot's, opened and shut vertically.  Its tongue, a horned substance,<br>
        furnished with several rows of pointed teeth, came out quivering from<br>
        this veritable pair of shears.  What a freak of nature, a bird's beak<br>
        on a mollusc!  Its spindle-like body formed a fleshy mass that might<br>
        weigh 4,000 to 5,000 lb.; the, varying colour changing with great<br>
        rapidity, according to the irritation of the animal, passed<br>
        successively from livid grey to reddish brown.  What irritated this<br>
        mollusc?  No doubt the presence of the Nautilus, more formidable than<br>
        itself, and on which its suckers or its jaws had no hold.  Yet, what<br>
        monsters these poulps are! what vitality the Creator has given them!<br>
        what vigour in their movements! and they possess three hearts!  Chance<br>
        had brought us in presence of this cuttlefish, and I did not wish to<br>
        lose the opportunity of carefully studying this specimen of<br>
        <a href=../site3/page3_848.html>internal_link2_text</a><br><br>
        cephalopods.  I overcame the horror that inspired me, and, taking a<br>
        pencil, began to draw it.<br>
        <br>
        "Perhaps this is the same which the Alector saw," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "No," replied the Canadian; "for this is whole, and the other had lost<br>
        its tail."<br>
        <br>
        "That is no reason," I replied.  "The arms and tails of these animals<br>
        are re-formed by renewal; and in seven years the tail of Bouguer's<br>
        cuttlefish has no doubt had time to grow."<br>
        <br>
        By this time other poulps appeared at the port light.  I counted seven.<br>
        They formed a procession after the Nautilus, and I heard their beaks<br>
        gnashing against the iron hull.  I continued my work.  These monsters<br>
        kept in the water with such precision that they seemed immovable.<br>
        Suddenly the Nautilus stopped.  A shock made it tremble in every plate.<br>
        <br>
        "Have we struck anything?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "In any case," replied the Canadian, "we shall be free, for we are<br>
        floating."<br>
        <br>
        The Nautilus was floating, no doubt, but it did not move.  A minute<br>
        passed.  Captain Nemo, followed by his lieutenant, entered the<br>
        drawing-room. I had not seen him for some time.  He seemed dull.<br>
        Without noticing or speaking to us, he went to the panel, looked at the<br>
        poulps, and said something to his lieutenant.  The latter went out.<br>
        Soon the panels were shut.  The ceiling was lighted.  I went towards<br>
        the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        "A curious collection of poulps?"  I said.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, indeed, Mr. Naturalist," he replied; "and we are going to fight<br>
        them, man to beast."<br>
        <br>
        I looked at him.  I thought I had not heard aright.<br>
        <br>
        "Man to beast?"  I repeated.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir.  The screw is stopped.  I think that the horny jaws of one<br>
        of the cuttlefish is entangled in the blades.  That is what prevents<br>
        our moving."<br>
        <br>
        "What are you going to do?"<br>
        <br>
        "Rise to the surface, and slaughter this vermin."<br>
        <br>
        "A difficult enterprise."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, indeed.  The electric bullets are powerless against the soft<br>
        flesh, where they do not find resistance enough to go off.  But we<br>
        shall attack them with the hatchet."<br>
        <br>
        "And the harpoon, sir," said the Canadian, "if you do not refuse my<br>
        help."<br>
        <br>
        "I will accept it, Master Land."<br>
        <br>
        "We will follow you," I said, and, following Captain Nemo, we went<br>
        towards the central staircase.<br>
        <br>
        There, about ten men with boarding-hatchets were ready for the attack.<br>
        Conseil and I took two hatchets; Ned Land seized a harpoon.  The<br>
        Nautilus had then risen to the surface.  One of the sailors, posted on<br>
        the top ladderstep, unscrewed the bolts of the panels.  But hardly were<br>
        the screws loosed, when the panel rose with great violence, evidently<br>
        drawn by the suckers of a poulp's arm.  Immediately one of these arms<br>
        slid like a serpent down the opening and twenty others were above.<br>
        With one blow of the axe, Captain Nemo cut this formidable tentacle,<br>
        that slid wriggling down the ladder.  Just as we were pressing one on<br>
        the other to reach the platform, two other arms, lashing the air, came<br>
        down on the seaman placed before Captain Nemo, and lifted him up with<br>
        irresistible power.  Captain Nemo uttered a cry, and rushed out.  We<br>
        hurried after him.<br>
        <br>
        What a scene!  The unhappy man, seized by the tentacle and fixed to the<br>
        suckers, was balanced in the air at the caprice of this enormous trunk.<br>
        He rattled in his throat, he was stifled, he cried, "Help! help!"<br>
        These words, spoken in French, startled me!  I had a fellow-countryman<br>
        on board, perhaps several!  That heart-rending cry!  I shall hear it<br>
        all my life.  The unfortunate man was lost.  Who could rescue him from<br>
        that powerful pressure?  However, Captain Nemo had rushed to the poulp,<br>
        and with one blow of the axe had cut through one arm.  His lieutenant<br>
        struggled furiously against other monsters that crept on the flanks of<br>
        the Nautilus.  The crew fought with their axes.  The Canadian, Conseil,<br>
        and I buried our weapons in the fleshy masses; a strong smell of musk<br>
        penetrated the atmosphere.  It was horrible!<br>
        <br>
        For one instant, I thought the unhappy man, entangled with the poulp,<br>
        would be torn from its powerful suction.  Seven of the eight arms had<br>
        been cut off.  One only wriggled in the air, brandishing the victim<br>
        like a feather.  But just as Captain Nemo and his lieutenant threw<br>
        themselves on it, the animal ejected a stream of black liquid.  We were<br>
        blinded with it.  When the cloud dispersed, the cuttlefish had<br>
        disappeared, and my unfortunate countryman with it.  Ten or twelve<br>
        poulps now invaded the platform and sides of the Nautilus.  We rolled<br>
        pell-mell into the midst of this nest of serpents, that wriggled on the<br>
        platform in the waves of blood and ink.  It seemed as though these<br>
        slimy tentacles sprang up like the hydra's heads.  Ned Land's harpoon,<br>
        at each stroke, was plunged into the staring eyes of the cuttle fish.<br>
        But my bold companion was suddenly overturned by the tentacles of a<br>
        monster he had not been able to avoid.<br>
        <br>
        Ah! how my heart beat with emotion and horror!  The formidable beak of<br>
        a cuttlefish was open over Ned Land.  The unhappy man would be cut in<br>
        two.  I rushed to his succour.  But Captain Nemo was before me; his axe<br>
        disappeared between the two enormous jaws, and, miraculously saved, the<br>
        Canadian, rising, plunged his harpoon deep into the triple heart of the<br>
        poulp.<br>
        <br>
        "I owed myself this revenge!" said the Captain to the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        Ned bowed without replying.  The combat had lasted a quarter of an<br>
        hour.  The monsters, vanquished and mutilated, left us at last, and<br>
        disappeared under the waves.  Captain Nemo, covered with blood, nearly<br>
        exhausted, gazed upon the sea that had swallowed up one of his<br>
        companions, and great tears gathered in his eyes.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XIX<br>
        <br>
        THE GULF STREAM<br>
        <br>
        This terrible scene of the 20th of April none of us can ever forget.  I<br>
        have written it under the influence of violent emotion.  Since then I<br>
        have revised the recital; I have read it to Conseil and to the<br>
        Canadian.  They found it exact as to facts, but insufficient as to<br>
        effect.  To paint such pictures, one must have the pen of the most<br>
        illustrious of our poets, the author of The Toilers of the Deep.<br>
        <br>
        I have said that Captain Nemo wept while watching the waves; his grief<br>
        was great.  It was the second companion he had lost since our arrival<br>
        on board, and what a death!  That friend, crushed, stifled, bruised by<br>
        the dreadful arms of a poulp, pounded by his iron jaws, would not rest<br>
        with his comrades in the peaceful coral cemetery!  In the midst of the<br>
        struggle, it was the despairing cry uttered by the unfortunate man that<br>
        had torn my heart.  The poor Frenchman, forgetting his conventional<br>
        language, had taken to his own mother tongue, to utter a last appeal!<br>
        Amongst the crew of the Nautilus, associated with the body and soul of<br>
        the Captain, recoiling like him from all contact with men, I had a<br>
        fellow-countryman. Did he alone represent France in this mysterious<br>
        association, evidently composed of individuals of divers nationalities?<br>
        It was one of these insoluble problems that rose up unceasingly before<br>
        my mind!<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo entered his room, and I saw him no more for some time.<br>
        But that he was sad and irresolute I could see by the vessel, of which<br>
        he was the soul, and which received all his impressions.  The Nautilus<br>
        did not keep on in its settled course; it floated about like a corpse<br>
        at the will of the waves.  It went at random.  He could not tear<br>
        himself away from the scene of the last struggle, from this sea that<br>
        had devoured one of his men.  Ten days passed thus.  It was not till<br>
        the 1st of May that the Nautilus resumed its northerly course, after<br>
        having sighted the Bahamas at the mouth of the Bahama Canal.  We were<br>
        then following the current from the largest river to the sea, that has<br>
        its banks, its fish, and its proper temperatures.  I mean the Gulf<br>
        Stream.  It is really a river, that flows freely to the middle of the<br>
        Atlantic, and whose waters do not mix with the ocean waters.  It is a<br>
        salt river, salter than the surrounding sea.  Its mean depth is 1,500<br>
        fathoms, its mean breadth ten miles.  In certain places the current<br>
        flows with the speed of two miles and a half an hour.  The body of its<br>
        waters is more considerable than that of all the rivers in the globe.<br>
        It was on this ocean river that the Nautilus then sailed.<br>
        <br>
        I must add that, during the night, the phosphorescent waters of the<br>
        Gulf Stream rivalled the electric power of our watch-light, especially<br>
        in the stormy weather that threatened us so frequently.  May 8th, we<br>
        were still crossing Cape Hatteras, at the height of the North Caroline.<br>
        The width of the Gulf Stream there is seventy-five miles, and its depth<br>
        210 yards.  The Nautilus still went at random; all supervision seemed<br>
        abandoned.  I thought that, under these circumstances, escape would be<br>
        possible.  Indeed, the inhabited shores offered anywhere an easy<br>
        refuge.  The sea was incessantly ploughed by the steamers that ply<br>
        between New York or Boston and the Gulf of Mexico, and overrun day and<br>
        night by the little schooners coasting about the several parts of the<br>
        American coast.  We could hope to be picked up.  It was a favourable<br>
        opportunity, notwithstanding the thirty miles that separated the<br>
        Nautilus from the coasts of the Union.  One unfortunate circumstance<br>
        thwarted the Canadian's plans.  The weather was very bad.  We were<br>
        nearing those shores where tempests are so frequent, that country of<br>
        waterspouts and cyclones actually engendered by the current of the Gulf<br>
        Stream.  To tempt the sea in a frail boat was certain destruction.  Ned<br>
        Land owned this himself.  He fretted, seized with nostalgia that flight<br>
        only could cure.<br>
        <br>
        "Master," he said that day to me, "this must come to an end.  I must<br>
        make a clean breast of it.  This Nemo is leaving land and going up to<br>
        the north.  But I declare to you that I have had enough of the South<br>
        Pole, and I will not follow him to the North."<br>
        <br>
        "What is to be done, Ned, since flight is impracticable just now?"<br>
        <br>
        "We must speak to the Captain," said he; "you said nothing when we were<br>
        in your native seas.  I will speak, now we are in mine.  When I think<br>
        that before long the Nautilus will be by Nova Scotia, and that there<br>
        near New foundland is a large bay, and into that bay the St. Lawrence<br>
        empties itself, and that the St. Lawrence is my river, the river by<br>
        Quebec, my native town--when I think of this, I feel furious, it makes<br>
        my hair stand on end.  Sir, I would rather throw myself into the sea!<br>
        I will not stay here!  I am stifled!"<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian was evidently losing all patience.  His vigorous nature<br>
        could not stand this prolonged imprisonment.  His face altered daily;<br>
        his temper became more surly.  I knew what he must suffer, for I was<br>
        seized with home-sickness myself.  Nearly seven months had passed<br>
        without our having had any news from land; Captain Nemo's isolation,<br>
        his altered spirits, especially since the fight with the poulps, his<br>
        taciturnity, all made me view things in a different light.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, sir?" said Ned, seeing I did not reply.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Ned, do you wish me to ask Captain Nemo his intentions<br>
        concerning us?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "Although he has already made them known?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes; I wish it settled finally.  Speak for me, in my name only, if you<br>
        like."<br>
        <br>
        "But I so seldom meet him.  He avoids me."<br>
        <br>
        "That is all the more reason for you to go to see him."<br>
        <br>
        I went to my room.  From thence I meant to go to Captain Nemo's.  It<br>
        would not do to let this opportunity of meeting him slip.  I knocked at<br>
        the door.  No answer.  I knocked again, then turned the handle.  The<br>
        door opened, I went in.  The Captain was there.  Bending over his<br>
        work-table, he had not heard me.  Resolved not to go without having<br>
        spoken, I approached him.  He raised his head quickly, frowned, and<br>
        said roughly, "You here!  What do you want?"<br>
        <br>
        "To speak to you, Captain."<br>
        <br>
        "But I am busy, sir; I am working.  I leave you at liberty to shut<br>
        yourself up; cannot I be allowed the same?"<br>
        <br>
        This reception was not encouraging; but I was determined to hear and<br>
        answer everything.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," I said coldly, "I have to speak to you on a matter that admits<br>
        of no delay."<br>
        <br>
        "What is that, sir?" he replied, ironically.  "Have you discovered<br>
        something that has escaped me, or has the sea delivered up any new<br>
        secrets?"<br>
        <br>
        We were at cross-purposes. But, before I could reply, he showed me an<br>
        open manuscript on his table, and said, in a more serious tone, "Here,<br>
        M. Aronnax, is a manuscript written in several languages.  It contains<br>
        the sum of my studies of the sea; and, if it please God, it shall not<br>
        perish with me.  This manuscript, signed with my name, complete with<br>
        the history of my life, will be shut up in a little floating case.  The<br>
        last survivor of all of us on board the Nautilus will throw this case<br>
        into the sea, and it will go whither it is borne by the waves."<br>
        <br>
        This man's name! his history written by himself!  His mystery would<br>
        then be revealed some day.<br>
        <br>
        "Captain," I said, "I can but approve of the idea that makes you act<br>
        thus.  The result of your studies must not be lost.  But the means you<br>
        employ seem to me to be primitive.  Who knows where the winds will<br>
        carry this case, and in whose hands it will fall?  Could you not use<br>
        some other means?  Could not you, or one of yours----"<br>
        <br>
        "Never, sir!" he said, hastily interrupting me.<br>
        <br>
        "But I and my companions are ready to keep this manuscript in store;<br>
        and, if you will put us at liberty----"<br>
        <br>
        "At liberty?" said the Captain, rising.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir; that is the subject on which I wish to question you.  For<br>
        seven months we have been here on board, and I ask you to-day, in the<br>
        name of my companions and in my own, if your intention is to keep us<br>
        here always?"<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax, I will answer you to-day as I did seven months ago:<br>
        Whoever enters the Nautilus, must never quit it."<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site3/page3_814.html>internal_link3_text</a><br><br>
        "You impose actual slavery upon us!"<br>
        <br>
        "Give it what name you please."<br>
        <br>
        "But everywhere the slave has the right to regain his liberty."<br>
        <br>
        "Who denies you this right?  Have I ever tried to chain you with an<br>
        oath?"<br>
        <br>
        He looked at me with his arms crossed.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," I said, "to return a second time to this subject will be neither<br>
        to your nor to my taste; but, as we have entered upon it, let us go<br>
        through with it.  I repeat, it is not only myself whom it concerns.<br>
        Study is to me a relief, a diversion, a passion that could make me<br>
        forget everything.  Like you, I am willing to live obscure, in the<br>
        frail hope of bequeathing one day, to future time, the result of my<br>
        labours.  But it is otherwise with Ned Land.  Every man, worthy of the<br>
        name, deserves some consideration.  Have you thought that love of<br>
        liberty, hatred of slavery, can give rise to schemes of revenge in a<br>
        nature like the Canadian's; that he could think, attempt, and try----"<br>
        <br>
        I was silenced; Captain Nemo rose.<br>
        <br>
        "Whatever Ned Land thinks of, attempts, or tries, what does it matter<br>
        to me?  I did not seek him!  It is not for my pleasure that I keep him<br>
        on board!  As for you, M. Aronnax, you are one of those who can<br>
        understand everything, even silence.  I have nothing more to say to<br>
        you.  Let this first time you have come to treat of this subject be the<br>
        last, for a second time I will not listen to you."<br>
        <br>
        I retired.  Our situation was critical.  I related my conversation to<br>
        my two companions.<br>
        <br>
        "We know now," said Ned, "that we can expect nothing from this man.<br>
        The Nautilus is nearing Long Island.  We will escape, whatever the<br>
        weather may be."<br>
        <br>
        But the sky became more and more threatening.  Symptoms of a hurricane<br>
        became manifest.  The atmosphere was becoming white and misty.  On the<br>
        horizon fine streaks of cirrhous clouds were succeeded by masses of<br>
        cumuli.  Other low clouds passed swiftly by.  The swollen sea rose in<br>
        huge billows.  The birds disappeared with the exception of the petrels,<br>
        those friends of the storm.  The barometer fell sensibly, and indicated<br>
        an extreme extension of the vapours.  The mixture of the storm glass<br>
        was decomposed under the influence of the electricity that pervaded the<br>
        atmosphere.  The tempest burst on the 18th of May, just as the Nautilus<br>
        was floating off Long Island, some miles from the port of New York.  I<br>
        can describe this strife of the elements! for, instead of fleeing to<br>
        the depths of the sea, Captain Nemo, by an unaccountable caprice, would<br>
        brave it at the surface.  The wind blew from the south-west at first.<br>
        Captain Nemo, during the squalls, had taken his place on the platform.<br>
        He had made himself fast, to prevent being washed overboard by the<br>
        monstrous waves.  I had hoisted myself up, and made myself fast also,<br>
        dividing my admiration between the tempest and this extraordinary man<br>
        who was coping with it.  The raging sea was swept by huge cloud-drifts,<br>
        which were actually saturated with the waves.  The Nautilus, sometimes<br>
        lying on its side, sometimes standing up like a mast, rolled and<br>
        pitched terribly.  About five o'clock a torrent of rain fell, that<br>
        lulled neither sea nor wind.  The hurri cane blew nearly forty leagues<br>
        an hour.  It is under these conditions that it overturns houses, breaks<br>
        iron gates, displaces twenty-four pounders.  However, the Nautilus, in<br>
        the midst of the tempest, confirmed the words of a clever engineer,<br>
        "There is no well-constructed hull that cannot defy the sea." This was<br>
        not a resisting rock; it was a steel spindle, obedient and movable,<br>
        without rigging or masts, that braved its fury with impunity.  However,<br>
        I watched these raging waves attentively.  They measured fifteen feet<br>
        in height, and 150 to 175 yards long, and their speed of propagation<br>
        was thirty feet per second.  Their bulk and power increased with the<br>
        depth of the water.  Such waves as these, at the Hebrides, have<br>
        displaced a mass weighing 8,400 lb.  They are they which, in the<br>
        tempest of December 23rd, 1864, after destroying the town of Yeddo, in<br>
        Japan, broke the same day on the shores of America.  The intensity of<br>
        the tempest increased with the night.  The barometer, as in 1860 at<br>
        Reunion during a cyclone, fell seven-tenths at the close of day.  I saw<br>
        a large vessel pass the horizon struggling painfully.  She was trying<br>
        to lie to under half steam, to keep up above the waves.  It was<br>
        probably one of the steamers of the line from New York to Liverpool, or<br>
        Havre.  It soon disappeared in the gloom.  At ten o'clock in the<br>
        evening the sky was on fire.  The atmosphere was streaked with vivid<br>
        lightning.  I could not bear the brightness of it; while the captain,<br>
        looking at it, seemed to envy the spirit of the tempest.  A terrible<br>
        noise filled the air, a complex noise, made up of the howls of the<br>
        crushed waves, the roaring of the wind, and the claps of thunder.  The<br>
        wind veered suddenly to all points of the horizon; and the cyclone,<br>
        rising in the east, returned after passing by the north, west, and<br>
        south, in the inverse course pursued by the circular storm of the<br>
        southern hemisphere.  Ah, that Gulf Stream!  It deserves its name of<br>
        the King of Tempests.  It is that which causes those formidable<br>
        cyclones, by the difference of temperature between its air and its<br>
        currents.  A shower of fire had succeeded the rain.  The drops of water<br>
        were changed to sharp spikes.  One would have thought that Captain Nemo<br>
        was courting a death worthy of himself, a death by lightning.  As the<br>
        Nautilus, pitching dreadfully, raised its steel spur in the air, it<br>
        seemed to act as a conductor, and I saw long sparks burst from it.<br>
        Crushed and without strength I crawled to the panel, opened it, and<br>
        descended to the saloon.  The storm was then at its height.  It was<br>
        impossible to stand upright in the interior of the Nautilus.  Captain<br>
        Nemo came down about twelve.  I heard the reservoirs filling by<br>
        degrees, and the Nautilus sank slowly beneath the waves.  Through the<br>
        open windows in the saloon I saw large fish terrified, passing like<br>
        phantoms in the water.  Some were struck before my eyes.  The Nautilus<br>
        was still descending.  I thought that at about eight fathoms deep we<br>
        should find a calm.  But no! the upper beds were too violently agitated<br>
        for that.  We had to seek repose at more than twenty-five fathoms in<br>
        the bowels of the deep.  But there, what quiet, what silence, what<br>
        peace!  Who could have told that such a hurricane had been let loose on<br>
        the surface of that ocean?<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XX<br>
        <br>
        FROM LATITUDE 47° 24' TO LONGITUDE 17° 28'<br>
        <br>
        In consequence of the storm, we had been thrown eastward once more.<br>
        All hope of escape on the shores of New York or St. Lawrence had faded<br>
        away; and poor Ned, in despair, had isolated himself like Captain Nemo.<br>
        Conseil and I, however, never left each other.  I said that the<br>
        Nautilus had gone aside to the east.  I should have said (to be more<br>
        exact) the north-east. For some days, it wandered first on the surface,<br>
        and then beneath it, amid those fogs so dreaded by sailors.  What<br>
        accidents are due to these thick fogs!  What shocks upon these reefs<br>
        when the wind drowns the breaking of the waves!  What collisions<br>
        between vessels, in spite of their warning lights, whistles, and alarm<br>
        bells!  And the bottoms of these seas look like a field of battle,<br>
        where still lie all the conquered of the ocean; some old and already<br>
        encrusted, others fresh and reflecting from their iron bands and copper<br>
        plates the brilliancy of our lantern.<br>
        <br>
        On the 15th of May we were at the extreme south of the Bank of<br>
        Newfoundland.  This bank consists of alluvia, or large heaps of organic<br>
        matter, brought either from the Equator by the Gulf Stream, or from the<br>
        North Pole by the counter-current of cold water which skirts the<br>
        American coast.  There also are heaped up those erratic blocks which<br>
        are carried along by the broken ice; and close by, a vast charnel-house<br>
        of molluscs, which perish here by millions.  The depth of the sea is<br>
        not great at Newfoundland--not more than some hundreds of fathoms; but<br>
        towards the south is a depression of 1,500 fathoms.  There the Gulf<br>
        Stream widens.  It loses some of its speed and some of its temperature,<br>
        but it becomes a sea.<br>
        <br>
        It was on the 17th of May, about 500 miles from Heart's Content, at a<br>
        depth of more than 1,400 fathoms, that I saw the electric cable lying<br>
        on the bottom.  Conseil, to whom I had not mentioned it, thought at<br>
        first that it was a gigantic sea-serpent. But I undeceived the worthy<br>
        fellow, and by way of consolation related several particulars in the<br>
        laying of this cable.  The first one was laid in the years 1857 and<br>
        1858; but, after transmitting about 400 telegrams, would not act any<br>
        longer.  In 1863 the engineers constructed an other one, measuring<br>
        2,000 miles in length, and weighing 4,500 tons, which was embarked on<br>
        the Great Eastern.  This attempt also failed.<br>
        <br>
        On the 25th of May the Nautilus, being at a depth of more than 1,918<br>
        fathoms, was on the precise spot where the rupture occurred which<br>
        ruined the enterprise.  It was within 638 miles of the coast of<br>
        Ireland; and at half-past two in the afternoon they discovered that<br>
        communication with Europe had ceased.  The electricians on board<br>
        resolved to cut the cable before fishing it up, and at eleven o'clock<br>
        at night they had recovered the damaged part.  They made another point<br>
        and spliced it, and it was once more submerged.  But some days after it<br>
        broke again, and in the depths of the ocean could not be recaptured.<br>
        The Americans, however, were not discouraged.  Cyrus Field, the bold<br>
        promoter of the enterprise, as he had sunk all his own fortune, set a<br>
        new subscription on foot, which was at once answered, and another cable<br>
        was constructed on better principles.  The bundles of conducting wires<br>
        were each enveloped in gutta-percha, and protected by a wadding of<br>
        hemp, contained in a metallic covering.  The Great Eastern sailed on<br>
        the 13th of July, 1866.  The operation worked well.  But one incident<br>
        occurred.  Several times in unrolling the cable they observed that<br>
        nails had recently been forced into it, evidently with the motive of<br>
        destroying it.  Captain Anderson, the officers, and engineers consulted<br>
        together, and had it posted up that, if the offender was surprised on<br>
        board, he would be thrown without further trial into the sea.  From<br>
        that time the criminal attempt was never repeated.<br>
        <br>
        On the 23rd of July the Great Eastern was not more than 500 miles from<br>
        Newfoundland, when they telegraphed from Ireland the news of the<br>
        armistice concluded between Prussia and Austria after Sadowa.  On the<br>
        27th, in the midst of heavy fogs, they reached the port of Heart's<br>
        Content.  The enterprise was successfully terminated; and for its first<br>
        despatch, young America addressed old Europe in these words of wisdom,<br>
        so rarely understood:  "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth<br>
        peace, goodwill towards men."<br>
        <br>
        I did not expect to find the electric cable in its primitive state,<br>
        such as it was on leaving the manufactory.  The long serpent, covered<br>
        with the remains of shells, bristling with foraminiferae, was encrusted<br>
        with a strong coating which served as a protection against all boring<br>
        molluscs.  It lay quietly sheltered from the motions of the sea, and<br>
        under a favourable pressure for the transmission of the electric spark<br>
        which passes from Europe to America in .32 of a second.  Doubtless this<br>
        cable will last for a great length of time, for they find that the<br>
        gutta-percha covering is improved by the sea-water. Besides, on this<br>
        level, so well chosen, the cable is never so deeply submerged as to<br>
        cause it to break.  The Nautilus followed it to the lowest depth, which<br>
        was more than 2,212 fathoms, and there it lay without any anchorage;<br>
        and then we reached the spot where the accident had taken place in<br>
        1863.  The bottom of the ocean then formed a valley about 100 miles<br>
        broad, in which Mont Blanc might have been placed without its summit<br>
        appearing above the waves.  This valley is closed at the east by a<br>
        perpendicular wall more than 2,000 yards high.  We arrived there on the<br>
        28th of May, and the Nautilus was then not more than 120 miles from<br>
        Ireland.<br>
        <br>
        Was Captain Nemo going to land on the British Isles?  No. To my great<br>
        surprise he made for the south, once more coming back towards European<br>
        seas.  In rounding the Emerald Isle, for one instant I caught sight of<br>
        Cape Clear, and the light which guides the thousands of vessels leaving<br>
        Glasgow or Liverpool.  An important question then arose in my mind.<br>
        Did the Nautilus dare entangle itself in the Manche?  Ned Land, who had<br>
        re-appeared since we had been nearing land, did not cease to question<br>
        me.  How could I answer?  Captain Nemo remained invisible.  After<br>
        having shown the Canadian a glimpse of American shores, was he going to<br>
        show me the coast of France?<br>
        <br>
        But the Nautilus was still going southward.  On the 30th of May, it<br>
        passed in sight of Land's End, between the extreme point of England and<br>
        the Scilly Isles, which were left to starboard.  If we wished to enter<br>
        the Manche, he must go straight to the east.  He did not do so.<br>
        <br>
        During the whole of the 31st of May, the Nautilus described a series of<br>
        circles on the water, which greatly interested me.  It seemed to be<br>
        seeking a spot it had some trouble in finding.  At noon, Captain Nemo<br>
        himself came to work the ship's log.  He spoke no word to me, but<br>
        seemed gloomier than ever.  What could sadden him thus?  Was it his<br>
        proxim ity to European shores?  Had he some recollections of his<br>
        abandoned country?  If not, what did he feel?  Remorse or regret?  For<br>
        a long while this thought haunted my mind, and I had a kind of<br>
        presentiment that before long chance would betray the captain's secrets.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 1st of June, the Nautilus continued the same process.<br>
        It was evidently seeking some particular spot in the ocean.  Captain<br>
        Nemo took the sun's altitude as he had done the day before.  The sea<br>
        was beautiful, the sky clear.  About eight miles to the east, a large<br>
        steam vessel could be discerned on the horizon.  No flag fluttered from<br>
        its mast, and I could not discover its nationality.  Some minutes<br>
        before the sun passed the meridian, Captain Nemo took his sextant, and<br>
        watched with great attention.  The perfect rest of the water greatly<br>
        helped the operation.  The Nautilus was motionless; it neither rolled<br>
        nor pitched.<br>
        <br>
        I was on the platform when the altitude was taken, and the Captain<br>
        pronounced these words:  "It is here."<br>
        <br>
        He turned and went below.  Had he seen the vessel which was changing<br>
        its course and seemed to be nearing us?  I could not tell.  I returned<br>
        to the saloon.  The panels closed, I heard the hissing of the water in<br>
        the reservoirs.  The Nautilus began to sink, following a vertical line,<br>
        for its screw communicated no motion to it.  Some minutes later it<br>
        stopped at a depth of more than 420 fathoms, resting on the ground.<br>
        The luminous ceiling was darkened, then the panels were opened, and<br>
        through the glass I saw the sea brilliantly illuminated by the rays of<br>
        our lantern for at least half a mile round us.<br>
        <br>
        I looked to the port side, and saw nothing but an immensity of quiet<br>
        waters.  But to starboard, on the bottom appeared a large protuberance,<br>
        which at once attracted my attention.  One would have thought it a ruin<br>
        buried under a coating of white shells, much resembling a covering of<br>
        snow.  Upon examining the mass attentively, I could recognise the<br>
        ever-thickening form of a vessel bare of its masts, which must have<br>
        sunk.  It certainly belonged to past times.  This wreck, to be thus<br>
        encrusted with the lime of the water, must already be able to count<br>
        many years passed at the bottom of the ocean.<br>
        <br>
        What was this vessel?  Why did the Nautilus visit its tomb?  Could it<br>
        have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water?  I<br>
        knew not what to think, when near me in a slow voice I heard Captain<br>
        Nemo say:<br>
        <br>
        "At one time this ship was called the Marseillais.  It carried<br>
        seventy-four guns, and was launched in 1762.  In 1778, the 13th of<br>
        August, commanded by La Poype-Ver trieux, it fought boldly against the<br>
        Preston.  In 1779, on the 4th of July, it was at the taking of Grenada,<br>
        with the squadron of Admiral Estaing.  In 1781, on the 5th of<br>
        September, it took part in the battle of Comte de Grasse, in Chesapeake<br>
        Bay.  In 1794, the French Republic changed its name.  On the 16th of<br>
        April, in the same year, it joined the squadron of Villaret Joyeuse, at<br>
        Brest, being entrusted with the escort of a cargo of corn coming from<br>
        America, under the command of Admiral Van Stebel.  On the 11th and 12th<br>
        Prairal of the second year, this squadron fell in with an English<br>
        vessel.  Sir, to-day is the 13th Prairal, the first of June, 1868.  It<br>
        is now seventy-four years ago, day for day on this very spot, in<br>
        <a href=../site3/page3_5292.html>internal_link4_text</a><br><br>
        latitude 47° 24', longitude 17° 28', that this vessel, after<br>
        fighting heroically, losing its three masts, with the water in its<br>
        hold, and the third of its crew disabled, preferred sinking with its<br>
        356 sailors to surrendering; and, nailing its colours to the poop,<br>
        disappeared under the waves to the cry of `Long live the Republic!'"<br>
        <br>
        "The Avenger!"  I exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir, the Avenger!  A good name!" muttered Captain Nemo, crossing<br>
        his arms.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XXI<br>
        <br>
        A HECATOMB<br>
        <br>
        The way of describing this unlooked-for scene, the history of the<br>
        patriot ship, told at first so coldly, and the emotion with which this<br>
        strange man pronounced the last words, the name of the Avenger, the<br>
        significance of which could not escape me, all impressed itself deeply<br>
        on my mind.  My eyes did not leave the Captain, who, with his hand<br>
        stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious<br>
        wreck.  Perhaps I was never to know who he was, from whence he came, or<br>
        where he was going to, but I saw the man move, and apart from the<br>
        _savant_.  It was no common misanthropy which had shut Captain Nemo and<br>
        his companions within the Nautilus, but a hatred, either monstrous or<br>
        sublime, which time could never weaken.  Did this hatred still seek for<br>
        vengeance?  The future would soon teach me that.  But the Nautilus was<br>
        rising slowly to the surface of the sea, and the form of the Avenger<br>
        disappeared by degrees from my sight.  Soon a slight rolling told me<br>
        that we were in the open air.  At that moment a dull boom was heard.  I<br>
        looked at the Captain.  He did not move.<br>
        <br>
        "Captain?" said I.<br>
        <br>
        He did not answer.  I left him and mounted the platform.  Conseil and<br>
        the Canadian were already there.<br>
        <br>
        "Where did that sound come from?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "It was a gunshot," replied Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        I looked in the direction of the vessel I had already seen.  It was<br>
        nearing the Nautilus, and we could see that it was putting on steam.<br>
        It was within six miles of us.<br>
        <br>
        "What is that ship, Ned?"<br>
        <br>
        "By its rigging, and the height of its lower masts," said the Canadian,<br>
        "I bet she is a ship-of-war. May it reach us; and, if necessary, sink<br>
        this cursed Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        "Friend Ned," replied Conseil, "what harm can it do to the Nautilus?<br>
        Can it attack it beneath the waves?  Can its cannonade us at the bottom<br>
        of the sea?"<br>
        <br>
        "Tell me, Ned," said I, "can you recognise what country she belongs to?"<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian knitted his eyebrows, dropped his eyelids, and screwed up<br>
        the corners of his eyes, and for a few moments fixed a piercing look<br>
        upon the vessel.<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir," he replied; "I cannot tell what nation she belongs to, for<br>
        she shows no colours.  But I can declare she is a man-of-war, for a<br>
        long pennant flutters from her main mast."<br>
        <br>
        For a quarter of an hour we watched the ship which was steaming towards<br>
        us.  I could not, however, believe that she could see the Nautilus from<br>
        that distance; and still less that she could know what this submarine<br>
        engine was.  Soon the Canadian informed me that she was a large,<br>
        armoured, two-decker ram.  A thick black smoke was pouring from her two<br>
        funnels.  Her closely-furled sails were stopped to her yards.  She<br>
        hoisted no flag at her mizzen-peak. The distance prevented us from<br>
        distinguishing the colours of her pennant, which floated like a thin<br>
        ribbon.  She advanced rapidly.  If Captain Nemo allowed her to<br>
        approach, there was a chance of salvation for us.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said Ned Land, "if that vessel passes within a mile of us I<br>
        shall throw myself into the sea, and I should advise you to do the<br>
        same."<br>
        <br>
        I did not reply to the Canadian's suggestion, but continued watching<br>
        the ship.  Whether English, French, American, or Russian, she would be<br>
        sure to take us in if we could only reach her.  Presently a white smoke<br>
        burst from the fore part of the vessel; some seconds after, the water,<br>
        agitated by the fall of a heavy body, splashed the stern of the<br>
        Nautilus, and shortly afterwards a loud explosion struck my ear.<br>
        <br>
        "What! they are firing at us!"  I exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        "So please you, sir," said Ned, "they have recognised the unicorn, and<br>
        they are firing at us."<br>
        <br>
        "But," I exclaimed, "surely they can see that there are men in the<br>
        case?"<br>
        <br>
        "It is, perhaps, because of that," replied Ned Land, looking at me.<br>
        <br>
        A whole flood of light burst upon my mind.  Doubtless they knew now how<br>
        to believe the stories of the pretended monster.  No doubt, on board<br>
        the Abraham Lincoln, when the Canadian struck it with the harpoon,<br>
        Commander Farragut had recognised in the supposed narwhal a submarine<br>
        vessel, more dangerous than a supernatural cetacean.  Yes, it must have<br>
        been so; and on every sea they were now seeking this engine of<br>
        destruction.  Terrible indeed! if, as we supposed, Captain Nemo<br>
        employed the Nautilus in works of vengeance.  On the night when we were<br>
        imprisoned in that cell, in the midst of the Indian Ocean, had he not<br>
        attacked some vessel?  The man buried in the coral cemetery, had he not<br>
        been a victim to the shock caused by the Nautilus?  Yes, I repeat it,<br>
        it must be so.  One part of the mysterious existence of Captain Nemo<br>
        had been unveiled; and, if his identity had not been recognised, at<br>
        least, the nations united against him were no longer hunting a<br>
        chimerical creature, but a man who had vowed a deadly hatred against<br>
        them.  All the formidable past rose before me.  Instead of meeting<br>
        friends on board the approaching ship, we could only expect pitiless<br>
        enemies.  But the shot rattled about us.  Some of them struck the sea<br>
        and ricochetted, losing themselves in the distance.  But none touched<br>
        the Nautilus.  The vessel was not more than three miles from us.  In<br>
        spite of the serious cannonade, Captain Nemo did not appear on the<br>
        platform; but, if one of the conical projectiles had struck the shell<br>
        of the Nautilus, it would have been fatal.  The Canadian then said,<br>
        "Sir, we must do all we can to get out of this dilemma.  Let us signal<br>
        them.  They will then, perhaps, understand that we are honest folks."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land took his handkerchief to wave in the air; but he had scarcely<br>
        displayed it, when he was struck down by an iron hand, and fell, in<br>
        spite of his great strength, upon the deck.<br>
        <br>
        "Fool!" exclaimed the Captain, "do you wish to be pierced by the spur<br>
        of the Nautilus before it is hurled at this vessel?"<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo was terrible to hear; he was still more terrible to see.<br>
        His face was deadly pale, with a spasm at his heart.  For an instant it<br>
        must have ceased to beat.  His pupils were fearfully contracted.  He<br>
        did not speak, he roared, as, with his body thrown forward, he wrung<br>
        the Canadian's shoulders.  Then, leaving him, and turning to the ship<br>
        of war, whose shot was still raining around him, he exclaimed, with a<br>
        powerful voice, "Ah, ship of an accursed nation, you know who I am!  I<br>
        do not want your colours to know you by!  Look! and I will show you<br>
        mine!"<br>
        <br>
        And on the fore part of the platform Captain Nemo unfurled a black<br>
        flag, similar to the one he had placed at the South Pole.  At that<br>
        moment a shot struck the shell of the Nautilus obliquely, without<br>
        piercing it; and, rebounding near the Captain, was lost in the sea.  He<br>
        shrugged his shoulders; and, addressing me, said shortly, "Go down, you<br>
        and your companions, go down!"<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," I cried, "are you going to attack this vessel?"<br>
        <br>
        "Sir, I am going to sink it."<br>
        <br>
        "You will not do that?"<br>
        <br>
        "I shall do it," he replied coldly.  "And I advise you not to judge me,<br>
        sir.  Fate has shown you what you ought not to have seen.  The attack<br>
        has begun; go down."<br>
        <br>
        "What is this vessel?"<br>
        <br>
        "You do not know?  Very well! so much the better!  Its nationality to<br>
        you, at least, will be a secret.  Go down!"<br>
        <br>
        We could but obey.  About fifteen of the sailors surrounded the<br>
        Captain, looking with implacable hatred at the vessel nearing them.<br>
        One could feel that the same desire of vengeance animated every soul.<br>
        I went down at the moment another projectile struck the Nautilus, and I<br>
        heard the Captain exclaim:<br>
        <br>
        "Strike, mad vessel!  Shower your useless shot!  And then, you will not<br>
        escape the spur of the Nautilus.  But it is not here that you shall<br>
        perish!  I would not have your ruins mingle with those of the Avenger!"<br>
        <br>
        I reached my room.  The Captain and his second had remained on the<br>
        platform.  The screw was set in motion, and the Nautilus, moving with<br>
        speed, was soon beyond the reach of the ship's guns.  But the pursuit<br>
        continued, and Captain Nemo contented himself with keeping his distance.<br>
        <br>
        About four in the afternoon, being no longer able to contain my<br>
        impatience, I went to the central staircase.  The panel was open, and I<br>
        ventured on to the platform.  The Captain was still walking up and down<br>
        with an agitated step.  He was looking at the ship, which was five or<br>
        six miles to leeward.<br>
        <br>
        He was going round it like a wild beast, and, drawing it eastward, he<br>
        allowed them to pursue.  But he did not attack.  Perhaps he still<br>
        hesitated?  I wished to mediate once more.  But I had scarcely spoken,<br>
        when Captain Nemo imposed silence, saying:<br>
        <br>
        "I am the law, and I am the judge!  I am the oppressed, and there is<br>
        the oppressor!  Through him I have lost all that I loved, cherished,<br>
        and venerated--country, wife, children, father, and mother.  I saw all<br>
        perish!  All that I hate is there!  Say no more!"<br>
        <br>
        I cast a last look at the man-of-war, which was putting on steam, and<br>
        rejoined Ned and Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "We will fly!"  I exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        "Good!" said Ned.  "What is this vessel?"<br>
        <br>
        "I do not know; but, whatever it is, it will be sunk before night.  In<br>
        any case, it is better to perish with it, than be made accomplices in a<br>
        retaliation the justice of which we cannot judge."<br>
        <br>
        "That is my opinion too," said Ned Land, coolly.  "Let us wait for<br>
        night."<br>
        <br>
        Night arrived.  Deep silence reigned on board.  The compass showed that<br>
        the Nautilus had not altered its course.  It was on the surface,<br>
        rolling slightly.  My companions and I resolved to fly when the vessel<br>
        should be near enough either to hear us or to see us; for the moon,<br>
        which would be full in two or three days, shone brightly.  Once on<br>
        board the ship, if we could not prevent the blow which threatened it,<br>
        we could, at least we would, do all that circumstances would allow.<br>
        Several times I thought the Nautilus was preparing for attack; but<br>
        Captain Nemo contented himself with allowing his adversary to approach,<br>
        and then fled once more before it.<br>
        <br>
        Part of the night passed without any incident.  We watched the<br>
        opportunity for action.  We spoke little, for we were too much moved.<br>
        Ned Land would have thrown himself into the sea, but I forced him to<br>
        wait.  According to my idea, the Nautilus would attack the ship at her<br>
        waterline, and then it would not only be possible, but easy to fly.<br>
        <br>
        At three in the morning, full of uneasiness, I mounted the platform.<br>
        Captain Nemo had not left it.  He was standing at the fore part near<br>
        his flag, which a slight breeze displayed above his head.  He did not<br>
        take his eyes from the vessel.  The intensity of his look seemed to<br>
        attract, and fascinate, and draw it onward more surely than if he had<br>
        been towing it.  The moon was then passing the meridian.  Jupiter was<br>
        rising in the east.  Amid this peaceful scene of nature, sky and ocean<br>
        rivalled each other in tranquillity, the sea offering to the orbs of<br>
        night the finest mirror they could ever have in which to reflect their<br>
        image.  As I thought of the deep calm of these elements, compared with<br>
        all those passions brooding imperceptibly within the Nautilus, I<br>
        shuddered.<br>
        <br>
        The vessel was within two miles of us.  It was ever nearing that<br>
        phosphorescent light which showed the presence of the Nautilus.  I<br>
        could see its green and red lights, and its white lantern hanging from<br>
        the large foremast.  An indistinct vibration quivered through its<br>
        rigging, showing that the furnaces were heated to the uttermost.<br>
        Sheaves of sparks and red ashes flew from the funnels, shining in the<br>
        atmosphere like stars.<br>
        <br>
        I remained thus until six in the morning, without Captain Nemo noticing<br>
        me.  The ship stood about a mile and a half from us, and with the first<br>
        dawn of day the firing began afresh.  The moment could not be far off<br>
        when, the Nautilus attacking its adversary, my companions and myself<br>
        should for ever leave this man.  I was preparing to go down to remind<br>
        them, when the second mounted the platform, accompanied by several<br>
        sailors.  Captain Nemo either did not or would not see them.  Some<br>
        steps were taken which might be called the signal for action.  They<br>
        were very simple.  The iron balustrade around the platform was lowered,<br>
        and the lantern and pilot cages were pushed within the shell until they<br>
        were flush with the deck.  The long surface of the steel cigar no<br>
        longer offered a single point to check its manoeuvres.  I returned to<br>
        the saloon.  The Nautilus still floated; some streaks of light were<br>
        filtering through the liquid beds.  With the undulations of the waves<br>
        the windows were brightened by the red streaks of the rising sun, and<br>
        this dreadful day of the 2nd of June had dawned.<br>
        <br>
        At five o'clock, the log showed that the speed of the Nautilus was<br>
        slackening, and I knew that it was allowing them to draw nearer.<br>
        Besides, the reports were heard more distinctly, and the projectiles,<br>
        labouring through the ambient water, were extinguished with a strange<br>
        hissing noise.<br>
        <br>
        "My friends," said I, "the moment is come.  One grasp of the hand, and<br>
        may God protect us!"<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land was resolute, Conseil calm, myself so nervous that I knew not<br>
        how to contain myself.  We all passed into the library; but the moment<br>
        I pushed the door opening on to the central staircase, I heard the<br>
        upper panel close sharply.  The Canadian rushed on to the stairs, but I<br>
        stopped him.  A well-known hissing noise told me that the water was<br>
        running into the reservoirs, and in a few minutes the Nautilus was some<br>
        yards beneath the surface of the waves.  I understood the manoeuvre.<br>
        It was too late to act.  The Nautilus did not wish to strike at the<br>
        impenetrable cuirass, but below the water-line, where the metallic<br>
        covering no longer protected it.<br>
