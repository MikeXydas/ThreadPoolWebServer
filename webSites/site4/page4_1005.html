        Rossini, Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, Meyerbeer, Herold, Wagner, Auber,<br>
        Gounod, and a number of others, scattered over a large model<br>
        piano-organ which occupied one of the panels of the drawing-room.<br>
        <br>
        "These musicians," replied Captain Nemo, "are the contemporaries of<br>
        Orpheus; for in the memory of the dead all chronological differences<br>
        are effaced; and I am dead, Professor; as much dead as those of your<br>
        friends who are sleeping six feet under the earth!"<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo was silent, and seemed lost in a profound reverie. I<br>
        contemplated him with deep interest, analysing in silence the strange<br>
        expression of his countenance. Leaning on his elbow against an angle of<br>
        a costly mosaic table, he no longer saw me,--he had forgotten my<br>
        presence.<br>
        <br>
        I did not disturb this reverie, and continued my observation of the<br>
        curiosities which enriched this drawing-room.<br>
        <br>
        Under elegant glass cases, fixed by copper rivets, were classed and<br>
        labelled the most precious productions of the sea which had ever been<br>
        presented to the eye of a naturalist.  My delight as a professor may be<br>
        conceived.<br>
        <br>
        The division containing the zoophytes presented the most curious<br>
        specimens of the two groups of polypi and echinodermes. In the first<br>
        group, the tubipores, were gorgones arranged like a fan, soft sponges<br>
        of Syria, ises of the Moluccas, pennatules, an admirable virgularia of<br>
        the Norwegian seas, variegated unbellulairae, alcyonariae, a whole<br>
        series of madrepores, which my master Milne Edwards has so cleverly<br>
        classified, amongst which I remarked some wonderful flabellinae<br>
        oculinae of the Island of Bourbon, the "Neptune's car" of the Antilles,<br>
        superb varieties of corals--in short, every species of those curious<br>
        polypi of which entire islands are formed, which will one day become<br>
        continents. Of the echinodermes, remarkable for their coating of<br>
        spines, asteri, sea-stars, pantacrinae, comatules, asterophons, echini,<br>
        holothuri, etc., represented individually a complete collection of this<br>
        group.<br>
        <br>
        A somewhat nervous conchyliologist would certainly have fainted before<br>
        other more numerous cases, in which were classified the specimens of<br>
        molluscs. It was a collection of inestimable value, which time fails me<br>
        to describe minutely. Amongst these specimens I will quote from memory<br>
        only the elegant royal hammer-fish of the Indian Ocean, whose regular<br>
        white spots stood out brightly on a red and brown ground, an imperial<br>
        spondyle, bright-coloured, bristling with spines, a rare specimen in<br>
        the European museums--(I estimated its value at not less than L1000); a<br>
        common hammer-fish of the seas of New Holland, which is only procured<br>
        with difficulty; exotic buccardia of Senegal; fragile white bivalve<br>
        shells, which a breath might shatter like a soap-bubble; several<br>
        varieties of the aspirgillum of Java, a kind of calcareous tube, edged<br>
        with leafy folds, and much debated by amateurs; a whole series of<br>
        trochi, some a greenish-yellow, found in the American seas, others a<br>
        reddish-brown, natives of Australian waters; others from the Gulf of<br>
        Mexico, remarkable for their imbricated shell; stellari found in the<br>
        Southern Seas; and last, the rarest of all, the magnificent spur of New<br>
        Zealand; and every description of delicate and fragile shells to which<br>
        science has given appropriate names.<br>
        <br>
        Apart, in separate compartments, were spread out chaplets of pearls of<br>
        the greatest beauty, which reflected the electric light in little<br>
        sparks of fire; pink pearls, torn from the pinna-marina of the Red Sea;<br>
        green pearls of the haliotyde iris; yellow, blue and black pearls, the<br>
        curious productions of the divers molluscs of every ocean, and certain<br>
        mussels of the water-courses of the North; lastly, several specimens of<br>
        inestimable value which had been gathered from the rarest pintadines.<br>
        Some of these pearls were larger than a pigeon's egg, and were worth as<br>
        much, and more than that which the traveller Tavernier sold to the Shah<br>
        of Persia for three millions, and surpassed the one in the possession<br>
        of the Imaum of Muscat, which I had believed to be unrivalled in the<br>
        world.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, to estimate the value of this collection was simply<br>
        impossible.  Captain Nemo must have expended millions in the<br>
        acquirement of these various specimens, and I was thinking what source<br>
        he could have drawn from, to have been able thus to gratify his fancy<br>
        for collecting, when I was interrupted by these words:<br>
        <br>
        "You are examining my shells, Professor?  Unquestionably they must be<br>
        interesting to a naturalist; but for me they have a far greater charm,<br>
        for I have collected them all with my own hand, and there is not a sea<br>
        on the face of the globe which has escaped my researches."<br>
        <br>
        "I can understand, Captain, the delight of wandering about in the midst<br>
        of such riches.  You are one of those who have collected their<br>
        treasures themselves.  No museum in Europe possesses such a collection<br>
        of the produce of the ocean.  But if I exhaust all my admiration upon<br>
        it, I shall have none left for the vessel which carries it.  I do not<br>
        wish to pry into your secrets:  but I must confess that this Nautilus,<br>
        with the motive power which is confined in it, the contrivances which<br>
        enable it to be worked, the powerful agent which propels it, all excite<br>
        my curiosity to the highest pitch.  I see suspended on the walls of<br>
        this room instruments of whose use I am ignorant."<br>
        <br>
        "You will find these same instruments in my own room, Professor, where<br>
        I shall have much pleasure in explaining their use to you.  But first<br>
        come and inspect the cabin which is set apart for your own use.  You<br>
        must see how you will be accommodated on board the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        I followed Captain Nemo who, by one of the doors opening from each<br>
        panel of the drawing-room, regained the waist.  He conducted me towards<br>
        the bow, and there I found, not a cabin, but an elegant room, with a<br>
        bed, dressing-table, and several other pieces of excellent furniture.<br>
        <br>
        I could only thank my host.<br>
        <br>
        "Your room adjoins mine," said he, opening a door, "and mine opens into<br>
        the drawing-room that we have just quitted."<br>
        <br>
        I entered the Captain's room:  it had a severe, almost a monkish<br>
        aspect.  A small iron bedstead, a table, some articles for the toilet;<br>
        the whole lighted by a skylight.  No comforts, the strictest<br>
        necessaries only.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo pointed to a seat.<br>
        <br>
        "Be so good as to sit down," he said.  I seated myself, and he began<br>
        thus:<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XI<br>
        <br>
        ALL BY ELECTRICITY<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said Captain Nemo, showing me the instruments hanging on the<br>
        walls of his room, "here are the contrivances required for the<br>
        navigation of the Nautilus.  Here, as in the drawing-room, I have them<br>
        always under my eyes, and they indicate my position and exact direction<br>
        in the middle of the ocean.  Some are known to you, such as the<br>
        thermometer, which gives the internal temperature of the Nautilus; the<br>
        barometer, which indicates the weight of the air and foretells the<br>
        changes of the weather; the hygrometer, which marks the dryness of the<br>
        atmosphere; the storm-glass, the contents of which, by decomposing,<br>
        announce the approach of tempests; the compass, which guides my course;<br>
        the sextant, which shows the latitude by the altitude of the sun;<br>
        chronometers, by which I calculate the longitude; and glasses for day<br>
        and night, which I use to examine the points of the horizon, when the<br>
        Nautilus rises to the surface of the waves."<br>
        <br>
        "These are the usual nautical instruments," I replied, "and I know the<br>
        use of them.  But these others, no doubt, answer to the particular<br>
        requirements of the Nautilus.  This dial with movable needle is a<br>
        manometer, is it not?"<br>
        <br>
        "It is actually a manometer.  But by communication with the water,<br>
        whose external pressure it indicates, it gives our depth at the same<br>
        time."<br>
        <br>
        "And these other instruments, the use of which I cannot guess?"<br>
        <br>
        "Here, Professor, I ought to give you some explanations.  Will you be<br>
        kind enough to listen to me?"<br>
        <br>
        He was silent for a few moments, then he said:<br>
        <br>
        "There is a powerful agent, obedient, rapid, easy, which conforms to<br>
        every use, and reigns supreme on board my vessel.  Everything is done<br>
        by means of it.  It lights, warms it, and is the soul of my mechanical<br>
        apparatus.  This agent is electricity."<br>
        <br>
        "Electricity?"  I cried in surprise.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "Nevertheless, Captain, you possess an extreme rapidity of movement,<br>
        which does not agree well with the power of electricity.  Until now,<br>
        its dynamic force has remained under restraint, and has only been able<br>
        to produce a small amount of power."<br>
        <br>
        "Professor," said Captain Nemo, "my electricity is not everybody's.<br>
        You know what sea-water is composed of.  In a thousand grammes are<br>
        found 96 1/2 per cent. of water, and about 2 2/3 per cent.  of chloride<br>
        of sodium; then, in a smaller quantity, chlorides of magnesium and of<br>
        potassium, bromide of magnesium, sulphate of magnesia, sulphate and<br>
        carbonate of lime.  You see, then, that chloride of sodium forms a<br>
        large part of it.  So it is this sodium that I extract from the<br>
        sea-water, and of which I compose my ingredients.  I owe all to the<br>
        ocean; it produces electricity, and electricity gives heat, light,<br>
        motion, and, in a word, life to the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        "But not the air you breathe?"<br>
        <br>
        "Oh!  I could manufacture the air necessary for my consumption, but it<br>
        is useless, because I go up to the surface of the water when I please.<br>
        However, if electricity does not furnish me with air to breathe, it<br>
        works at least the powerful pumps that are stored in spacious<br>
        reservoirs, and which enable me to prolong at need, and as long as I<br>
        will, my stay in the depths of the sea.  It gives a uniform and<br>
        unintermittent light, which the sun does not.  Now look at this clock;<br>
        it is electrical, and goes with a regularity that defies the best<br>
        chronometers.  I have divided it into twenty-four hours, like the<br>
        Italian clocks, because for me there is neither night nor day, sun nor<br>
        moon, but only that factitious light that I take with me to the bottom<br>
        of the sea.  Look! just now, it is ten o'clock in the morning."<br>
        <br>
        "Exactly."<br>
        <br>
        "Another application of electricity.  This dial hanging in front of us<br>
        indicates the speed of the Nautilus.  An electric thread puts it in<br>
        communication with the screw, and the needle indicates the real speed.<br>
        Look! now we are spinning along with a uniform speed of fifteen miles<br>
        an hour."<br>
        <br>
        "It is marvelous!  And I see, Captain, you were right to make use of<br>
        this agent that takes the place of wind, water, and steam."<br>
        <br>
        "We have not finished, M. Aronnax," said Captain Nemo, rising.  "If you<br>
        will allow me, we will examine the stern of the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        Really, I knew already the anterior part of this submarine boat, of<br>
        which this is the exact division, starting from the ship's head: the<br>
        dining-room, five yards long, separated from the library by a<br>
        water-tight partition; the library, five yards long; the large<br>
        drawing-room, ten yards long, separated from the Captain's room by a<br>
        second water-tight partition; the said room, five yards in length;<br>
        mine, two and a half yards; and, lastly a reservoir of air, seven and a<br>
        half yards, that extended to the bows.  Total length thirty five yards,<br>
        or one hundred and five feet.  The partitions had doors that were shut<br>
        hermetically by means of india-rubber instruments, and they ensured the<br>
        safety of the Nautilus in case of a leak.<br>
        <br>
        I followed Captain Nemo through the waist, and arrived at the centre of<br>
        the boat.  There was a sort of well that opened between two partitions.<br>
        An iron ladder, fastened with an iron hook to the partition, led to the<br>
        upper end.  I asked the Captain what the ladder was used for.<br>
        <br>
        "It leads to the small boat," he said.<br>
        <br>
        "What! have you a boat?"  I exclaimed, in surprise.<br>
        <br>
        "Of course; an excellent vessel, light and insubmersible, that serves<br>
        either as a fishing or as a pleasure boat."<br>
        <br>
        "But then, when you wish to embark, you are obliged to come to the<br>
        surface of the water?"<br>
        <br>
        "Not at all.  This boat is attached to the upper part of the hull of<br>
        the Nautilus, and occupies a cavity made for it.  It is decked, quite<br>
        water-tight, and held together by solid bolts.  This ladder leads to a<br>
        man-hole made in the hull of the Nautilus, that corresponds with a<br>
        similar hole made in the side of the boat.  By this double opening I<br>
        get into the small vessel.  They shut the one belonging to the<br>
        Nautilus; I shut the other by means of screw pressure.  I undo the<br>
        bolts, and the little boat goes up to the surface of the sea with<br>
        prodigious rapidity.  I then open the panel of the bridge, carefully<br>
        shut till then; I mast it, hoist my sail, take my oars, and I'm off."<br>
        <br>
        "But how do you get back on board?"<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site1/page1_2190.html>external_link0_text</a><br><br>
        "I do not come back, M. Aronnax; the Nautilus comes to me."<br>
        <br>
        "By your orders?"<br>
        <br>
        "By my orders.  An electric thread connects us.  I telegraph to it, and<br>
        that is enough."<br>
        <br>
        "Really," I said, astonished at these marvels, "nothing can be more<br>
        simple."<br>
        <br>
        After having passed by the cage of the staircase that led to the<br>
        platform, I saw a cabin six feet long, in which Conseil and Ned Land,<br>
        enchanted with their repast, were devouring it with avidity.  Then a<br>
        door opened into a kitchen nine feet long, situated between the large<br>
        store-rooms. There electricity, better than gas itself, did all the<br>
        cooking.  The streams under the furnaces gave out to the sponges of<br>
        platina a heat which was regularly kept up and distributed.  They also<br>
        heated a distilling apparatus, which, by evaporation, furnished<br>
        excellent drinkable water.  Near this kitchen was a bathroom<br>
        comfortably furnished, with hot and cold water taps.<br>
        <br>
        Next to the kitchen was the berth-room of the vessel, sixteen feet<br>
        long.  But the door was shut, and I could not see the management of it,<br>
        which might have given me an idea of the number of men employed on<br>
        board the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        At the bottom was a fourth partition that separated this office from<br>
        the engine-room. A door opened, and I found myself in the compartment<br>
        where Captain Nemo--certainly an engineer of a very high order--had<br>
        arranged his locomotive machinery.  This engine-room, clearly lighted,<br>
        did not measure less than sixty-five feet in length.  It was divided<br>
        into two parts; the first contained the materials for producing<br>
        electricity, and the second the machinery that connected it with the<br>
        screw.  I examined it with great interest, in order to understand the<br>
        machinery of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        "You see," said the Captain, "I use Bunsen's contrivances, not<br>
        Ruhmkorff's. Those would not have been powerful enough.  Bunsen's are<br>
        fewer in number, but strong and large, which experience proves to be<br>
        the best.  The electricity produced passes forward, where it works, by<br>
        electro-magnets of great size, on a system of levers and cog-wheels<br>
        that transmit the movement to the axle of the screw.  This one, the<br>
        diameter of which is nineteen feet, and the thread twenty-three feet,<br>
        performs about 120 revolutions in a second."<br>
        <br>
        "And you get then?"<br>
        <br>
        "A speed of fifty miles an hour."<br>
        <br>
        "I have seen the Nautilus manoeuvre before the Abraham Lincoln, and I<br>
        have my own ideas as to its speed.  But this is not enough.  We must<br>
        see where we go.  We must be able to direct it to the right, to the<br>
        left, above, below.  How do you get to the great depths, where you find<br>
        an increasing resistance, which is rated by hundreds of atmospheres?<br>
        How do you return to the surface of the ocean?  And how do you maintain<br>
        yourselves in the requisite medium?  Am I asking too much?"<br>
        <br>
        "Not at all, Professor," replied the Captain, with some hesitation;<br>
        "since you may never leave this submarine boat.  Come into the saloon,<br>
        it is our usual study, and there you will learn all you want to know<br>
        about the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XII<br>
        <br>
        SOME FIGURES<br>
        <br>
        A moment after we were seated on a divan in the saloon smoking.  The<br>
        Captain showed me a sketch that gave the plan, section, and elevation<br>
        of the Nautilus.  Then he began his description in these words:<br>
        <br>
        "Here, M. Aronnax, are the several dimensions of the boat you are in.<br>
        It is an elongated cylinder with conical ends.  It is very like a cigar<br>
        in shape, a shape already adopted in London in several constructions of<br>
        the same sort.  The length of this cylinder, from stem to stern, is<br>
        exactly 232 feet, and its maximum breadth is twenty-six feet.  It is<br>
        not built quite like your long-voyage steamers, but its lines are<br>
        sufficiently long, and its curves prolonged enough, to allow the water<br>
        to slide off easily, and oppose no obstacle to its passage.  These two<br>
        dimensions enable you to obtain by a simple calculation the surface and<br>
        cubic contents of the Nautilus.  Its area measures 6,032 feet; and its<br>
        contents about 1,500 cubic yards; that is to say, when completely<br>
        immersed it displaces 50,000 feet of water, or weighs 1,500 tons.<br>
        <br>
        "When I made the plans for this submarine vessel, I meant that<br>
        nine-tenths should be submerged:  consequently it ought only to<br>
        displace nine-tenths of its bulk, that is to say, only to weigh that<br>
        number of tons.  I ought not, therefore, to have exceeded that weight,<br>
        constructing it on the aforesaid dimensions.<br>
        <br>
        "The Nautilus is composed of two hulls, one inside, the other outside,<br>
        joined by T-shaped irons, which render it very strong.  Indeed, owing<br>
        to this cellular arrangement it resists like a block, as if it were<br>
        solid.  Its sides cannot yield; it coheres spontaneously, and not by<br>
        the closeness of its rivets; and its perfect union of the materials<br>
        enables it to defy the roughest seas.<br>
        <br>
        "These two hulls are composed of steel plates, whose density is from .7<br>
        to .8 that of water.  The first is not less than two inches and a half<br>
        thick and weighs 394 tons.  The second envelope, the keel, twenty<br>
        inches high and ten thick, weighs only sixty-two tons.  The engine, the<br>
        ballast, the several accessories and apparatus appendages, the<br>
        partitions and bulkheads, weigh 961.62 tons.  Do you follow all this?"<br>
        <br>
        "I do."<br>
        <br>
        "Then, when the Nautilus is afloat under these circumstances, one-tenth<br>
        is out of the water.  Now, if I have made reservoirs of a size equal to<br>
        this tenth, or capable of holding 150 tons, and if I fill them with<br>
        water, the boat, weighing then 1,507 tons, will be completely immersed.<br>
        That would happen, Professor.  These reservoirs are in the lower part<br>
        of the Nautilus.  I turn on taps and they fill, and the vessel sinks<br>
        that had just been level with the surface."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Captain, but now we come to the real difficulty.  I can<br>
        understand your rising to the surface; but, diving below the surface,<br>
        does not your submarine contrivance encounter a pressure, and<br>
        consequently undergo an upward thrust of one atmosphere for every<br>
        thirty feet of water, just about fifteen pounds per square inch?"<br>
        <br>
        "Just so, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "Then, unless you quite fill the Nautilus, I do not see how you can<br>
        draw it down to those depths."<br>
        <br>
        "Professor, you must not confound statics with dynamics or you will be<br>
        exposed to grave errors.  There is very little labour spent in<br>
        attaining the lower regions of the ocean, for all bodies have a<br>
        tendency to sink.  When I wanted to find out the necessary increase of<br>
        weight required to sink the Nautilus, I had only to calculate the<br>
        reduction of volume that sea-water acquires according to the depth."<br>
        <br>
        "That is evident."<br>
        <br>
        "Now, if water is not absolutely incompressible, it is at least capable<br>
        of very slight compression.  Indeed, after the most recent calculations<br>
        this reduction is only .000436 of an atmosphere for each thirty feet of<br>
        depth.  If we want to sink 3,000 feet, I should keep account of the<br>
        reduction of bulk under a pressure equal to that of a column of water<br>
        of a thousand feet.  The calculation is easily verified.  Now, I have<br>
        supplementary reservoirs capable of holding a hundred tons.  Therefore<br>
        I can sink to a considerable depth.  When I wish to rise to the level<br>
        of the sea, I only let off the water, and empty all the reservoirs if I<br>
        want the Nautilus to emerge from the tenth part of her total capacity."<br>
        <br>
        I had nothing to object to these reasonings.<br>
        <br>
        "I admit your calculations, Captain," I replied; "I should be wrong to<br>
        dispute them since daily experience confirms them; but I foresee a real<br>
        difficulty in the way."<br>
        <br>
        "What, sir?"<br>
        <br>
        "When you are about 1,000 feet deep, the walls of the Nautilus bear a<br>
        pressure of 100 atmospheres.  If, then, just now you were to empty the<br>
        supplementary reservoirs, to lighten the vessel, and to go up to the<br>
        surface, the pumps must overcome the pressure of 100 atmospheres, which<br>
        is 1,500 lbs.  per square inch.  From that a power----"<br>
        <br>
        "That electricity alone can give," said the Captain, hastily.  "I<br>
        repeat, sir, that the dynamic power of my engines is almost infinite.<br>
        The pumps of the Nautilus have an enormous power, as you must have<br>
        observed when their jets of water burst like a torrent upon the Abraham<br>
        Lincoln.  Besides, I use subsidiary reservoirs only to attain a mean<br>
        depth of 750 to 1,000 fathoms, and that with a view of managing my<br>
        machines.  Also, when I have a mind to visit the depths of the ocean<br>
        five or six mlles below the surface, I make use of slower but not less<br>
        infallible means."<br>
        <br>
        "What are they, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "That involves my telling you how the Nautilus is worked."<br>
        <br>
        "I am impatient to learn."<br>
        <br>
        "To steer this boat to starboard or port, to turn, in a word, following<br>
        a horizontal plan, I use an ordinary rudder fixed on the back of the<br>
        stern-post, and with one wheel and some tackle to steer by.  But I can<br>
        also make the Nautilus rise and sink, and sink and rise, by a vertical<br>
        movement by means of two inclined planes fastened to its sides,<br>
        opposite the centre of flotation, planes that move in every direction,<br>
        and that are worked by powerful levers from the interior.  If the<br>
        planes are kept parallel with the boat, it moves horizontally.  If<br>
        slanted, the Nautilus, according to this inclination, and under the<br>
        influence of the screw, either sinks diagonally or rises diagonally as<br>
        it suits me.  And even if I wish to rise more quickly to the surface, I<br>
        ship the screw, and the pressure of the water causes the Nautilus to<br>
        rise vertically like a balloon filled with hydrogen."<br>
        <br>
        "Bravo, Captain!  But how can the steersman follow the route in the<br>
        middle of the waters?"<br>
        <br>
        "The steersman is placed in a glazed box, that is raised about the hull<br>
        of the Nautilus, and furnished with lenses."<br>
        <br>
        "Are these lenses capable of resisting such pressure?"<br>
        <br>
        "Perfectly.  Glass, which breaks at a blow, is, nevertheless, capable<br>
        of offering considerable resistance.  During some experiments of<br>
        fishing by electric light in 1864 in the Northern Seas, we saw plates<br>
        less than a third of an inch thick resist a pressure of sixteen<br>
        atmospheres.  Now, the glass that I use is not less than thirty times<br>
        thicker."<br>
        <br>
        "Granted.  But, after all, in order to see, the light must exceed the<br>
        darkness, and in the midst of the darkness in the water, how can you<br>
        see?"<br>
        <br>
        "Behind the steersman's cage is placed a powerful electric reflector,<br>
        the rays from which light up the sea for half a mile in front."<br>
        <br>
        "Ah! bravo, bravo, Captain!  Now I can account for this phosphorescence<br>
        in the supposed narwhal that puzzled us so.  I now ask you if the<br>
        boarding of the Nautilus and of the Scotia, that has made such a noise,<br>
        has been the result of a chance rencontre?"<br>
        <br>
        "Quite accidental, sir.  I was sailing only one fathom below the<br>
        surface of the water when the shock came.  It had no bad result."<br>
        <br>
        "None, sir.  But now, about your rencontre with the Abraham Lincoln?"<br>
        <br>
        "Professor, I am sorry for one of the best vessels in the American<br>
        navy; but they attacked me, and I was bound to defend myself.  I<br>
        contented myself, however, with putting the frigate hors de combat; she<br>
        will not have any difficulty in getting repaired at the next port."<br>
        <br>
        "Ah, Commander! your Nautilus is certainly a marvellous boat."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Professor; and I love it as if it were part of myself.  If danger<br>
        threatens one of your vessels on the ocean, the first impression is the<br>
        feeling of an abyss above and below.  On the Nautilus men's hearts<br>
        never fail them.  No defects to be afraid of, for the double shell is<br>
        as firm as iron; no rigging to attend to; no sails for the wind to<br>
        carry away; no boilers to burst; no fire to fear, for the vessel is<br>
        made of iron, not of wood; no coal to run short, for electricity is the<br>
        only mechanical agent; no collision to fear, for it alone swims in deep<br>
        water; no tempest to brave, for when it dives below the water it<br>
        reaches absolute tranquillity.  There, sir! that is the perfection of<br>
        vessels!  And if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in<br>
        the vessel than the builder, and the builder than the captain himself,<br>
        you understand the trust I repose in my Nautilus; for I am at once<br>
        captain, builder, and engineer."<br>
        <br>
        "But how could you construct this wonderful Nautilus in secret?"<br>
        <br>
        "Each separate portion, M. Aronnax, was brought from different parts of<br>
        the globe."<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site4/page4_2175.html>internal_link1_text</a><br><br>
        "But these parts had to be put together and arranged?"<br>
        <br>
        "Professor, I had set up my workshops upon a desert island in the<br>
        ocean.  There my workmen, that is to say, the brave men that I<br>
        instructed and educated, and myself have put together our Nautilus.<br>
        Then, when the work was finished, fire destroyed all trace of our<br>
        proceedings on this island, that I could have jumped over if I had<br>
        liked."<br>
        <br>
        "Then the cost of this vessel is great?"<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax, an iron vessel costs L145 per ton.  Now the Nautilus<br>
        weighed 1,500. It came therefore to L67,500, and L80,000 more for<br>
        fitting it up, and about L200,000, with the works of art and the<br>
        collections it contains."<br>
        <br>
        "One last question, Captain Nemo."<br>
        <br>
        "Ask it, Professor."<br>
        <br>
        "You are rich?"<br>
        <br>
        "Immensely rich, sir; and I could, without missing it, pay the national<br>
        debt of France."<br>
        <br>
        I stared at the singular person who spoke thus.  Was he playing upon my<br>
        credulity?  The future would decide that.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XIII<br>
        <br>
        THE BLACK RIVER<br>
        <br>
        The portion of the terrestrial globe which is covered by water is<br>
        estimated at upwards of eighty millions of acres.  This fluid mass<br>
        comprises two billions two hundred and fifty millions of cubic miles,<br>
        forming a spherical body of a diameter of sixty leagues, the weight of<br>
        which would be three quintillions of tons.  To comprehend the meaning<br>
        of these figures, it is necessary to observe that a quintillion is to a<br>
        billion as a billion is to unity; in other words, there are as many<br>
        billions in a quintillion as there are units in a billion.  This mass<br>
        of fluid is equal to about the quantity of water which would be<br>
        discharged by all the rivers of the earth in forty thousand years.<br>
        <br>
        During the geological epochs the ocean originally prevailed everywhere.<br>
        Then by degrees, in the silurian period, the tops of the mountains<br>
        began to appear, the islands emerged, then disappeared in partial<br>
        deluges, reappeared, became settled, formed continents, till at length<br>
        the earth became geographically arranged, as we see in the present day.<br>
        The solid had wrested from the liquid thirty-seven million six hundred<br>
        and fifty-seven square miles, equal to twelve billions nine hundred and<br>
        sixty millions of acres.<br>
        <br>
        The shape of continents allows us to divide the waters into five great<br>
        portions:  the Arctic or Frozen Ocean, the Antarctic, or Frozen Ocean,<br>
        the Indian, the Atlantic, and the Pacific Oceans.<br>
        <br>
        The Pacific Ocean extends from north to south between the two Polar<br>
        Circles, and from east to west between Asia and America, over an extent<br>
        of 145 degrees of longitude.  It is the quietest of seas; its currents<br>
        are broad and slow, it has medium tides, and abundant rain.  Such was<br>
        the ocean that my fate destined me first to travel over under these<br>
        strange conditions.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said Captain Nemo, "we will, if you please, take our bearings<br>
        and fix the starting-point of this voyage.  It is a quarter to twelve;<br>
        I will go up again to the surface."<br>
        <br>
        The Captain pressed an electric clock three times.  The pumps began to<br>
        drive the water from the tanks; the needle of the manometer marked by a<br>
        different pressure the ascent of the Nautilus, then it stopped.<br>
        <br>
        "We have arrived," said the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        I went to the central staircase which opened on to the platform,<br>
        clambered up the iron steps, and found myself on the upper part of the<br>
        Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        The platform was only three feet out of water.  The front and back of<br>
        the Nautilus was of that spindle-shape which caused it justly to be<br>
        compared to a cigar.  I noticed that its iron plates, slightly<br>
        overlaying each other, resembled the shell which clothes the bodies of<br>
        our large terrestrial reptiles.  It explained to me how natural it was,<br>
        in spite of all glasses, that this boat should have been taken for a<br>
        marine animal.<br>
        <br>
        Toward the middle of the platform the longboat, half buried in the hull<br>
        of the vessel, formed a slight excrescence.  Fore and aft rose two<br>
        cages of medium height with inclined sides, and partly closed by thick<br>
        lenticular glasses; one destined for the steersman who directed the<br>
        Nautilus, the other containing a brilliant lantern to give light on the<br>
        road.<br>
        <br>
        The sea was beautiful, the sky pure.  Scarcely could the long vehicle<br>
        feel the broad undulations of the ocean.  A light breeze from the east<br>
        rippled the surface of the waters.  The horizon, free from fog, made<br>
        observation easy.  Nothing was in sight.  Not a quicksand, not an<br>
        island.  A vast desert.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo, by the help of his sextant, took the altitude of the sun,<br>
        which ought also to give the latitude.  He waited for some moments till<br>
        its disc touched the horizon.  Whilst taking observations not a muscle<br>
        moved, the instrument could not have been more motionless in a hand of<br>
        marble.<br>
        <br>
        "Twelve o'clock, sir," said he.  "When you like----"<br>
        <br>
        I cast a last look upon the sea, slightly yellowed by the Japanese<br>
        coast, and descended to the saloon.<br>
        <br>
        "And now, sir, I leave you to your studies," added the Captain; "our<br>
        course is E.N.E., our depth is twenty-six fathoms.  Here are maps on a<br>
        large scale by which you may follow it.  The saloon is at your<br>
        disposal, and, with your permission, I will retire."  Captain Nemo<br>
        bowed, and I remained alone, lost in thoughts all bearing on the<br>
        commander of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        For a whole hour was I deep in these reflections, seeking to pierce<br>
        this mystery so interesting to me.  Then my eyes fell upon the vast<br>
        planisphere spread upon the table, and I placed my finger on the very<br>
        spot where the given latitude and longitude crossed.<br>
        <br>
        The sea has its large rivers like the continents.  They are special<br>
        currents known by their temperature and their colour.  The most<br>
        remarkable of these is known by the name of the Gulf Stream.  Science<br>
        has decided on the globe the direction of five principal currents: one<br>
        in the North Atlantic, a second in the South, a third in the North<br>
        Pacific, a fourth in the South, and a fifth in the Southern Indian<br>
        Ocean.  It is even probable that a sixth current existed at one time or<br>
        another in the Northern Indian Ocean, when the Caspian and Aral Seas<br>
        formed but one vast sheet of water.<br>
        <br>
        At this point indicated on the planisphere one of these currents was<br>
        rolling, the Kuro-Scivo of the Japanese, the Black River, which,<br>
        leaving the Gulf of Bengal, where it is warmed by the perpendicular<br>
        rays of a tropical sun, crosses the Straits of Malacca along the coast<br>
        of Asia, turns into the North Pacific to the Aleutian Islands, carrying<br>
        with it trunks of camphor-trees and other indigenous productions, and<br>
        edging the waves of the ocean with the pure indigo of its warm water.<br>
        It was this current that the Nautilus was to follow.  I followed it<br>
        with my eye; saw it lose itself in the vastness of the Pacific, and<br>
        felt myself drawn with it, when Ned Land and Conseil appeared at the<br>
        door of the saloon.<br>
        <br>
        My two brave companions remained petrified at the sight of the wonders<br>
        spread before them.<br>
        <br>
        "Where are we, where are we?" exclaimed the Canadian.  "In the museum<br>
        at Quebec?"<br>
        <br>
        "My friends," I answered, making a sign for them to enter, "you are not<br>
        in Canada, but on board the Nautilus, fifty yards below the level of<br>
        the sea."<br>
        <br>
        "But, M. Aronnax," said Ned Land, "can you tell me how many men there<br>
        are on board?  Ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred?"<br>
        <br>
        "I cannot answer you, Mr. Land; it is better to abandon for a time all<br>
        idea of seizing the Nautilus or escaping from it.  This ship is a<br>
        masterpiece of modern industry, and I should be sorry not to have seen<br>
        it.  Many people would accept the situation forced upon us, if only to<br>
        move amongst such wonders.  So be quiet and let us try and see what<br>
        passes around us."<br>
        <br>
        "See!" exclaimed the harpooner, "but we can see nothing in this iron<br>
        prison!  We are walking--we are sailing--blindly."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land had scarcely pronounced these words when all was suddenly<br>
        darkness.  The luminous ceiling was gone, and so rapidly that my eyes<br>
        received a painful impression.<br>
        <br>
        We remained mute, not stirring, and not knowing what surprise awaited<br>
        us, whether agreeable or disagreeable.  A sliding noise was heard: one<br>
        would have said that panels were working at the sides of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        "It is the end of the end!" said Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        Suddenly light broke at each side of the saloon, through two oblong<br>
        openings.  The liquid mass appeared vividly lit up by the electric<br>
        gleam.  Two crystal plates separated us from the sea.  At first I<br>
        trembled at the thought that this frail partition might break, but<br>
        strong bands of copper bound them, giving an almost infinite power of<br>
        resistance.<br>
        <br>
        The sea was distinctly visible for a mile all round the Nautilus.  What<br>
        a spectacle!  What pen can describe it?  Who could paint the effects of<br>
        the light through those transparent sheets of water, and the softness<br>
        of the successive gradations from the lower to the superior strata of<br>
        the ocean?<br>
        <br>
        We know the transparency of the sea and that its clearness is far<br>
        beyond that of rock-water. The mineral and organic substances which it<br>
        holds in suspension heightens its transparency.  In certain parts of<br>
        the ocean at the Antilles, under seventy-five fathoms of water, can be<br>
        seen with surprising clearness a bed of sand.  The penetrating power of<br>
        the solar rays does not seem to cease for a depth of one hundred and<br>
        fifty fathoms.  But in this middle fluid travelled over by the<br>
        Nautilus, the electric brightness was produced even in the bosom of the<br>
        waves.  It was no longer luminous water, but liquid light.<br>
        <br>
        On each side a window opened into this unexplored abyss.  The obscurity<br>
        of the saloon showed to advantage the brightness outside, and we looked<br>
        out as if this pure crystal had been the glass of an immense aquarium.<br>
        <br>
        "You wished to see, friend Ned; well, you see now."<br>
        <br>
        "Curious! curious!" muttered the Canadian, who, forgetting his<br>
        ill-temper, seemed to submit to some irresistible attraction; "and one<br>
        would come further than this to admire such a sight!"<br>
        <br>
        "Ah!" thought I to myself, "I understand the life of this man; he has<br>
        made a world apart for himself, in which he treasures all his greatest<br>
        wonders."<br>
        <br>
        For two whole hours an aquatic army escorted the Nautilus.  During<br>
        their games, their bounds, while rivalling each other in beauty,<br>
        brightness, and velocity, I distinguished the green labre; the banded<br>
        mullet, marked by a double line of black; the round-tailed goby, of a<br>
        white colour, with violet spots on the back; the Japanese scombrus, a<br>
        beautiful mackerel of these seas, with a blue body and silvery head;<br>
        the brilliant azurors, whose name alone defies description; some banded<br>
        spares, with variegated fins of blue and yellow; the woodcocks of the<br>
        seas, some specimens of which attain a yard in length; Japanese<br>
        salamanders, spider lampreys, serpents six feet long, with eyes small<br>
        and lively, and a huge mouth bristling with teeth; with many other<br>
        species.<br>
        <br>
        Our imagination was kept at its height, interjections followed quickly<br>
        on each other.  Ned named the fish, and Conseil classed them.  I was in<br>
        ecstasies with the vivacity of their movements and the beauty of their<br>
        forms.  Never had it been given to me to surprise these animals, alive<br>
        and at liberty, in their natural element.  I will not mention all the<br>
        varieties which passed before my dazzled eyes, all the collection of<br>
        the seas of China and Japan.  These fish, more numerous than the birds<br>
        of the air, came, attracted, no doubt, by the brilliant focus of the<br>
        electric light.<br>
        <br>
        Suddenly there was daylight in the saloon, the iron panels closed<br>
        again, and the enchanting vision disappeared.  But for a long time I<br>
        dreamt on, till my eyes fell on the instruments hanging on the<br>
        partition.  The compass still showed the course to be E.N.E., the<br>
        manometer indicated a pressure of five atmospheres, equivalent to a<br>
        depth of twenty five fathoms, and the electric log gave a speed of<br>
        fifteen miles an hour.  I expected Captain Nemo, but he did not appear.<br>
        The clock marked the hour of five.<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land and Conseil returned to their cabin, and I retired to my<br>
        chamber.  My dinner was ready.  It was composed of turtle soup made of<br>
        <a href=../site0/page0_6556.html>external_link2_text</a><br><br>
        the most delicate hawks bills, of a surmullet served with puff paste<br>
        (the liver of which, prepared by itself, was most delicious), and<br>
        fillets of the emperor-holocanthus, the savour of which seemed to me<br>
        superior even to salmon.<br>
        <br>
        I passed the evening reading, writing, and thinking.  Then sleep<br>
        overpowered me, and I stretched myself on my couch of zostera, and<br>
        slept profoundly, whilst the Nautilus was gliding rapidly through the<br>
        current of the Black River.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XIV<br>
        <br>
        A NOTE OF INVITATION<br>
        <br>
        The next day was the 9th of November.  I awoke after a long sleep of<br>
        twelve hours.  Conseil came, according to custom, to know "how I passed<br>
        the night," and to offer his services.  He had left his friend the<br>
        Canadian sleeping like a man who had never done anything else all his<br>
        life.  I let the worthy fellow chatter as he pleased, without caring to<br>
        answer him.  I was preoccupied by the absence of the Captain during our<br>
        sitting of the day before, and hoping to see him to-day.<br>
        <br>
        As soon as I was dressed I went into the saloon.  It was deserted.  I<br>
        plunged into the study of the shell treasures hidden behind the glasses.<br>
        <br>
        The whole day passed without my being honoured by a visit from Captain<br>
        Nemo.  The panels of the saloon did not open.  Perhaps they did not<br>
        wish us to tire of these beautiful things.<br>
        <br>
        The course of the Nautilus was E.N.E., her speed twelve knots, the<br>
        depth below the surface between twenty-five and thirty fathoms.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, 10th of November, the same desertion, the same solitude.<br>
        I did not see one of the ship's crew: Ned and Conseil spent the greater<br>
        part of the day with me.  They were astonished at the puzzling absence<br>
        of the Captain.  Was this singular man ill?--had he altered his<br>
        intentions with regard to us?<br>
        <br>
        After all, as Conseil said, we enjoyed perfect liberty, we were<br>
        delicately and abundantly fed.  Our host kept to his terms of the<br>
        treaty.  We could not complain, and, indeed, the singularity of our<br>
        fate reserved such wonderful compensation for us that we had no right<br>
        to accuse it as yet.<br>
        <br>
        That day I commenced the journal of these adventures which has enabled<br>
        me to relate them with more scrupulous exactitude and minute detail.<br>
        <br>
        11th November, early in the morning.  The fresh air spreading over the<br>
        interior of the Nautilus told me that we had come to the surface of the<br>
        ocean to renew our supply of oxygen.  I directed my steps to the<br>
        central staircase, and mounted the platform.<br>
        <br>
        It was six o'clock, the weather was cloudy, the sea grey, but calm.<br>
        Scarcely a billow.  Captain Nemo, whom I hoped to meet, would he be<br>
        there?  I saw no one but the steersman imprisoned in his glass cage.<br>
        Seated upon the projection formed by the hull of the pinnace, I inhaled<br>
        the salt breeze with delight.<br>
        <br>
        By degrees the fog disappeared under the action of the sun's rays, the<br>
        radiant orb rose from behind the eastern horizon.  The sea flamed under<br>
        its glance like a train of gunpowder.  The clouds scattered in the<br>
        heights were coloured with lively tints of beautiful shades, and<br>
        numerous "mare's tails," which betokened wind for that day.  But what<br>
        was wind to this Nautilus, which tempests could not frighten!<br>
        <br>
        I was admiring this joyous rising of the sun, so gay, and so<br>
        life-giving, when I heard steps approaching the platform.  I was<br>
        prepared to salute Captain Nemo, but it was his second (whom I had<br>
        already seen on the Captain's first visit) who appeared.  He advanced<br>
        on the platform, not seeming to see me.  With his powerful glass to his<br>
        eye, he scanned every point of the horizon with great attention.  This<br>
        examination over, he approached the panel and pronounced a sentence in<br>
        exactly these terms.  I have remembered it, for every morning it was<br>
        repeated under exactly the same conditions.  It was thus worded:<br>
        <br>
        "Nautron respoc lorni virch."<br>
        <br>
        What it meant I could not say.<br>
        <br>
        These words pronounced, the second descended.  I thought that the<br>
        Nautilus was about to return to its submarine navigation.  I regained<br>
        the panel and returned to my chamber.<br>
        <br>
        Five days sped thus, without any change in our situation.  Every<br>
        morning I mounted the platform.  The same phrase was pronounced by the<br>
        same individual.  But Captain Nemo did not appear.<br>
        <br>
        I had made up my mind that I should never see him again, when, on the<br>
        16th November, on returning to my room with Ned and Conseil, I found<br>
        upon my table a note addressed to me.  I opened it impatiently.  It was<br>
        written in a bold, clear hand, the characters rather pointed, recalling<br>
        the German type.  The note was worded as follows:<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        TO PROFESSOR ARONNAX, On board the Nautilus.  16th of November, 1867.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo invites Professor Aronnax to a hunting-party, which will<br>
        take place to-morrow morning in the forests of the Island of Crespo.<br>
        He hopes that nothing will prevent the Professor from being present,<br>
        and he will with pleasure see him joined by his companions.<br>
        <br>
        CAPTAIN NEMO, Commander of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "A hunt!" exclaimed Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "And in the forests of the Island of Crespo!" added Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Oh! then the gentleman is going on terra firma?" replied Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        "That seems to me to be clearly indicated," said I, reading the letter<br>
        once more.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, we must accept," said the Canadian.  "But once more on dry<br>
        ground, we shall know what to do.  Indeed, I shall not be sorry to eat<br>
        a piece of fresh venison."<br>
        <br>
        Without seeking to reconcile what was contradictory between Captain<br>
        Nemo's manifest aversion to islands and continents, and his invitation<br>
        to hunt in a forest, I contented myself with replying:<br>
        <br>
        "Let us first see where the Island of Crespo is."<br>
        <br>
        I consulted the planisphere, and in 32° 40' N. lat. and 157°<br>
        50' W. long., I found a small island, recognised in 1801 by Captain<br>
        Crespo, and marked in the ancient Spanish maps as Rocca de la Plata,<br>
        the meaning of which is The Silver Rock.  We were then about eighteen<br>
        hundred miles from our starting-point, and the course of the Nautilus,<br>
        a little changed, was bringing it back towards the southeast.<br>
        <br>
        I showed this little rock, lost in the midst of the North Pacific, to<br>
        my companions.<br>
        <br>
        "If Captain Nemo does sometimes go on dry ground," said I, "he at least<br>
        chooses desert islands."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land shrugged his shoulders without speaking, and Conseil and he<br>
        left me.<br>
        <br>
        After supper, which was served by the steward, mute and impassive, I<br>
        went to bed, not without some anxiety.<br>
        <br>
        The next morning, the 17th of November, on awakening, I felt that the<br>
        Nautilus was perfectly still.  I dressed quickly and entered the saloon.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo was there, waiting for me.  He rose, bowed, and asked me<br>
        if it was convenient for me to accompany him.  As he made no allusion<br>
        to his absence during the last eight days, I did not mention it, and<br>
        simply answered that my companions and myself were ready to follow him.<br>
        <br>
        We entered the dining-room, where breakfast was served.<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax," said the Captain, "pray, share my breakfast without<br>
        ceremony; we will chat as we eat.  For, though I promised you a walk in<br>
        the forest, I did not undertake to find hotels there.  So breakfast as<br>
        a man who will most likely not have his dinner till very late."<br>
        <br>
        I did honour to the repast.  It was composed of several kinds of fish,<br>
        and slices of sea-cucumber, and different sorts of seaweed.  Our drink<br>
        consisted of pure water, to which the Captain added some drops of a<br>
        fermented liquor, extracted by the Kamschatcha method from a seaweed<br>
        known under the name of Rhodomenia palmata.  Captain Nemo ate at first<br>
        without saying a word.  Then he began:<br>
        <br>
        "Sir, when I proposed to you to hunt in my submarine forest of Crespo,<br>
        you evidently thought me mad.  Sir, you should never judge lightly of<br>
        any man."<br>
        <br>
        "But Captain, believe me----"<br>
        <br>
        "Be kind enough to listen, and you will then see whether you have any<br>
        cause to accuse me of folly and contradiction."<br>
        <br>
        "I listen."<br>
        <br>
        "You know as well as I do, Professor, that man can live under water,<br>
        providing he carries with him a sufficient supply of breathable air.<br>
        In submarine works, the workman, clad in an impervious dress, with his<br>
        head in a metal helmet, receives air from above by means of forcing<br>
        pumps and regulators."<br>
        <br>
        "That is a diving apparatus," said I.<br>
        <br>
        "Just so, but under these conditions the man is not at liberty; he is<br>
        attached to the pump which sends him air through an india-rubber tube,<br>
        and if we were obliged to be thus held to the Nautilus, we could not go<br>
        far."<br>
        <br>
        "And the means of getting free?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "It is to use the Rouquayrol apparatus, invented by two of your own<br>
        countrymen, which I have brought to perfection for my own use, and<br>
        which will allow you to risk yourself under these new physiological<br>
        conditions without any organ whatever suffering.  It consists of a<br>
        reservoir of thick iron plates, in which I store the air under a<br>
        pressure of fifty atmospheres.  This reservoir is fixed on the back by<br>
        means of braces, like a soldier's knapsack.  Its upper part forms a box<br>
        in which the air is kept by means of a bellows, and therefore cannot<br>
        escape unless at its normal tension.  In the Rouquayrol apparatus such<br>
        as we use, two india rubber pipes leave this box and join a sort of<br>
        tent which holds the nose and mouth; one is to introduce fresh air, the<br>
        other to let out the foul, and the tongue closes one or the other<br>
        according to the wants of the respirator.  But I, in encountering great<br>
        pressures at the bottom of the sea, was obliged to shut my head, like<br>
        that of a diver in a ball of copper; and it is to this ball of copper<br>
        that the two pipes, the inspirator and the expirator, open."<br>
        <br>
        "Perfectly, Captain Nemo; but the air that you carry with you must soon<br>
        be used; when it only contains fifteen per cent.  of oxygen it is no<br>
        longer fit to breathe."<br>
        <br>
        "Right!  But I told you, M. Aronnax, that the pumps of the Nautilus<br>
        allow me to store the air under considerable pressure, and on those<br>
        conditions the reservoir of the apparatus can furnish breathable air<br>
        for nine or ten hours."<br>
        <br>
        "I have no further objections to make," I answered.  "I will only ask<br>
        you one thing, Captain--how can you light your road at the bottom of<br>
        the sea?"<br>
        <br>
        "With the Ruhmkorff apparatus, M. Aronnax; one is carried on the back,<br>
        the other is fastened to the waist.  It is composed of a Bunsen pile,<br>
        which I do not work with bichromate of potash, but with sodium.  A wire<br>
        is introduced which collects the electricity produced, and directs it<br>
        towards a particularly made lantern.  In this lantern is a spiral glass<br>
        which contains a small quantity of carbonic gas.  When the apparatus is<br>
        at work this gas becomes luminous, giving out a white and continuous<br>
        light.  Thus provided, I can breathe and I can see."<br>
        <br>
        "Captain Nemo, to all my objections you make such crushing answers that<br>
        I dare no longer doubt.  But, if I am forced to admit the Rouquayrol<br>
        and Ruhmkorff apparatus, I must be allowed some reservations with<br>
        regard to the gun I am to carry."<br>
        <br>
        "But it is not a gun for powder," answered the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        "Then it is an air-gun."<br>
        <br>
        "Doubtless!  How would you have me manufacture gun powder on board,<br>
        without either saltpetre, sulphur, or charcoal?"<br>
        <br>
        "Besides," I added, "to fire under water in a medium eight hundred and<br>
        fifty-five times denser than the air, we must conquer very considerable<br>
        resistance."<br>
        <br>
        "That would be no difficulty.  There exist guns, according to Fulton,<br>
        perfected in England by Philip Coles and Burley, in France by Furcy,<br>
        <a href=../site4/page4_2164.html>internal_link3_text</a><br><br>
        and in Italy by Landi, which are furnished with a peculiar system of<br>
        closing, which can fire under these conditions.  But I repeat, having<br>
        no powder, I use air under great pressure, which the pumps of the<br>
        Nautilus furnish abundantly."<br>
        <br>
        "But this air must be rapidly used?"<br>
        <br>
        "Well, have I not my Rouquayrol reservoir, which can furnish it at<br>
        need?  A tap is all that is required.  Besides M. Aronnax, you must see<br>
        yourself that, during our submarine hunt, we can spend but little air<br>
        and but few balls."<br>
        <br>
        "But it seems to me that in this twilight, and in the midst of this<br>
        fluid, which is very dense compared with the atmosphere, shots could<br>
        not go far, nor easily prove mortal."<br>
        <br>
        "Sir, on the contrary, with this gun every blow is mortal; and, however<br>
        lightly the animal is touched, it falls as if struck by a thunderbolt."<br>
        <br>
        "Why?"<br>
        <br>
        "Because the balls sent by this gun are not ordinary balls, but little<br>
        cases of glass.  These glass cases are covered with a case of steel,<br>
        and weighted with a pellet of lead; they are real Leyden bottles, into<br>
        which the electricity is forced to a very high tension.  With the<br>
        slightest shock they are discharged, and the animal, however strong it<br>
        may be, falls dead.  I must tell you that these cases are size number<br>
        four, and that the charge for an ordinary gun would be ten."<br>
        <br>
        "I will argue no longer," I replied, rising from the table.  "I have<br>
        nothing left me but to take my gun.  At all events, I will go where you<br>
        go."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo then led me aft; and in passing before Ned's and Conseil's<br>
        cabin, I called my two companions, who followed promptly.  We then came<br>
        to a cell near the machinery-room, in which we put on our walking-dress.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XV<br>
        <br>
        A WALK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA<br>
        <br>
        This cell was, to speak correctly, the arsenal and wardrobe of the<br>
        Nautilus.  A dozen diving apparatuses hung from the partition waiting<br>
        our use.<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land, on seeing them, showed evident repugnance to dress himself in<br>
        one.<br>
        <br>
        "But, my worthy Ned, the forests of the Island of Crespo are nothing<br>
        but submarine forests."<br>
        <br>
        "Good!" said the disappointed harpooner, who saw his dreams of fresh<br>
        meat fade away.  "And you, M. Aronnax, are you going to dress yourself<br>
        in those clothes?"<br>
        <br>
        "There is no alternative, Master Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "As you please, sir," replied the harpooner, shrugging his shoulders;<br>
        "but, as for me, unless I am forced, I will never get into one."<br>
        <br>
        "No one will force you, Master Ned," said Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "Is Conseil going to risk it?" asked Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "I follow my master wherever he goes," replied Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        At the Captain's call two of the ship's crew came to help us dress in<br>
        these heavy and impervious clothes, made of india-rubber without seam,<br>
        and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure.  One would<br>
        have thought it a suit of armour, both supple and resisting.  This suit<br>
        formed trousers and waistcoat.  The trousers were finished off with<br>
        thick boots, weighted with heavy leaden soles.  The texture of the<br>
        waistcoat was held together by bands of copper, which crossed the<br>
        chest, protecting it from the great pressure of the water, and leaving<br>
        the lungs free to act; the sleeves ended in gloves, which in no way<br>
        restrained the movement of the hands.  There was a vast difference<br>
        noticeable between these consummate apparatuses and the old cork<br>
        breastplates, jackets, and other contrivances in vogue during the<br>
        eighteenth century.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo and one of his companions (a sort of Hercules, who must<br>
        have possessed great strength), Conseil and myself were soon enveloped<br>
        in the dresses.  There remained nothing more to be done but to enclose<br>
        our heads in the metal box.  But, before proceeding to this operation,<br>
        I asked the Captain's permission to examine the guns.<br>
        <br>
        One of the Nautilus men gave me a simple gun, the butt end of which,<br>
        made of steel, hollow in the centre, was rather large.  It served as a<br>
        reservoir for compressed air, which a valve, worked by a spring,<br>
        allowed to escape into a metal tube.  A box of projectiles in a groove<br>
        in the thickness of the butt end contained about twenty of these<br>
        electric balls, which, by means of a spring, were forced into the<br>
        barrel of the gun.  As soon as one shot was fired, another was ready.<br>
        <br>
        "Captain Nemo," said I, "this arm is perfect, and easily handled: I<br>
        only ask to be allowed to try it.  But how shall we gain the bottom of<br>
        the sea?"<br>
        <br>
        "At this moment, Professor, the Nautilus is stranded in five fathoms,<br>
        and we have nothing to do but to start."<br>
        <br>
        "But how shall we get off?"<br>
        <br>
        "You shall see."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo thrust his head into the helmet, Conseil and I did the<br>
        same, not without hearing an ironical "Good sport!" from the Canadian.<br>
        The upper part of our dress terminated in a copper collar upon which<br>
        was screwed the metal helmet.  Three holes, protected by thick glass,<br>
        allowed us to see in all directions, by simply turning our head in the<br>
        interior of the head-dress. As soon as it was in position, the<br>
        Rouquayrol apparatus on our backs began to act; and, for my part, I<br>
        could breathe with ease.<br>
        <br>
        With the Ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt, and the gun in my hand, I<br>
        was ready to set out.  But to speak the truth, imprisoned in these<br>
        heavy garments, and glued to the deck by my leaden soles, it was<br>
        impossible for me to take a step.<br>
        <br>
        But this state of things was provided for.  I felt myself being pushed<br>
        into a little room contiguous to the wardrobe room.  My companions<br>
        followed, towed along in the same way.  I heard a water-tight door,<br>
        furnished with stopper plates, close upon us, and we were wrapped in<br>
        profound darkness.<br>
        <br>
        After some minutes, a loud hissing was heard.  I felt the cold mount<br>
        from my feet to my chest.  Evidently from some part of the vessel they<br>
        had, by means of a tap, given entrance to the water, which was invading<br>
        us, and with which the room was soon filled.  A second door cut in the<br>
        side of the Nautilus then opened.  We saw a faint light.  In another<br>
        instant our feet trod the bottom of the sea.<br>
        <br>
        And now, how can I retrace the impression left upon me by that walk<br>
        under the waters?  Words are impotent to relate such wonders!  Captain<br>
        Nemo walked in front, his companion followed some steps behind.<br>
        Conseil and I remained near each other, as if an exchange of words had<br>
        been possible through our metallic cases.  I no longer felt the weight<br>
        of my clothing, or of my shoes, of my reservoir of air, or my thick<br>
        helmet, in the midst of which my head rattled like an almond in its<br>
        shell.<br>
        <br>
        The light, which lit the soil thirty feet below the surface of the<br>
        ocean, astonished me by its power.  The solar rays shone through the<br>
        watery mass easily, and dissipated all colour, and I clearly<br>
        distinguished objects at a distance of a hundred and fifty yards.<br>
        Beyond that the tints darkened into fine gradations of ultramarine, and<br>
        faded into vague obscurity.  Truly this water which surrounded me was<br>
        but another air denser than the terrestrial atmosphere, but almost as<br>
        transparent.  Above me was the calm surface of the sea.  We were<br>
        walking on fine, even sand, not wrinkled, as on a flat shore, which<br>
        retains the impression of the billows.  This dazzling carpet, really a<br>
        reflector, repelled the rays of the sun with wonderful intensity, which<br>
        accounted for the vibration which penetrated every atom of liquid.<br>
        Shall I be believed when I say that, at the depth of thirty feet, I<br>
        could see as if I was in broad daylight?<br>
        <br>
        For a quarter of an hour I trod on this sand, sown with the impalpable<br>
        dust of shells.  The hull of the Nautilus, resembling a long shoal,<br>
        disappeared by degrees; but its lantern, when darkness should overtake<br>
        us in the waters, would help to guide us on board by its distinct rays.<br>
        <br>
        Soon forms of objects outlined in the distance were discernible.  I<br>
        recognised magnificent rocks, hung with a tapestry of zoophytes of the<br>
        most beautiful kind, and I was at first struck by the peculiar effect<br>
        of this medium.<br>
        <br>
        It was then ten in the morning; the rays of the sun struck the surface<br>
        of the waves at rather an oblique angle, and at the touch of their<br>
        light, decomposed by refraction as through a prism, flowers, rocks,<br>
        plants, shells, and polypi were shaded at the edges by the seven solar<br>
        colours.  It was marvellous, a feast for the eyes, this complication of<br>
        coloured tints, a perfect kaleidoscope of green, yellow, orange,<br>
        violet, indigo, and blue; in one word, the whole palette of an<br>
        enthusiastic colourist!  Why could I not communicate to Conseil the<br>
        lively sensations which were mounting to my brain, and rival him in<br>
        expressions of admiration?  For aught I knew, Captain Nemo and his<br>
        companion might be able to exchange thoughts by means of signs<br>
        previously agreed upon.  So, for want of better, I talked to myself; I<br>
        declaimed in the copper box which covered my head, thereby expending<br>
        more air in vain words than was perhaps wise.<br>
        <br>
        Various kinds of isis, clusters of pure tuft-coral, prickly fungi, and<br>
        anemones formed a brilliant garden of flowers, decked with their<br>
        collarettes of blue tentacles, sea-stars studding the sandy bottom.  It<br>
        was a real grief to me to crush under my feet the brilliant specimens<br>
        of molluscs which strewed the ground by thousands, of hammerheads,<br>
        donaciae (veritable bounding shells), of staircases, and red<br>
        helmet-shells, angel-wings, and many others produced by this<br>
        inexhaustible ocean.  But we were bound to walk, so we went on, whilst<br>
        above our heads waved medusae whose umbrellas of opal or rose-pink,<br>
        escalloped with a band of blue, sheltered us from the rays of the sun<br>
        and fiery pelagiae, which, in the darkness, would have strewn our path<br>
        with phosphorescent light.<br>
        <br>
        All these wonders I saw in the space of a quarter of a mile, scarcely<br>
        stopping, and following Captain Nemo, who beckoned me on by signs.<br>
        Soon the nature of the soil changed; to the sandy plain succeeded an<br>
        extent of slimy mud which the Americans call "ooze," composed of equal<br>
        parts of silicious and calcareous shells.  We then travelled over a<br>
        plain of seaweed of wild and luxuriant vegetation.  This sward was of<br>
        close texture, and soft to the feet, and rivalled the softest carpet<br>
        woven by the hand of man.  But whilst verdure was spread at our feet,<br>
        it did not abandon our heads.  A light network of marine plants, of<br>
        that inexhaustible family of seaweeds of which more than two thousand<br>
        kinds are known, grew on the surface of the water.<br>
        <br>
        I noticed that the green plants kept nearer the top of the sea, whilst<br>
        the red were at a greater depth, leaving to the black or brown the care<br>
        of forming gardens and parterres in the remote beds of the ocean.<br>
        <br>
        We had quitted the Nautilus about an hour and a half.  It was near<br>
        noon; I knew by the perpendicularity of the sun's rays, which were no<br>
        longer refracted.  The magical colours disappeared by degrees, and the<br>
        shades of emerald and sapphire were effaced.  We walked with a regular<br>
        step, which rang upon the ground with astonishing intensity; the<br>
        slightest noise was transmitted with a quickness to which the ear is<br>
        unaccustomed on the earth; indeed, water is a better conductor of sound<br>
        than air, in the ratio of four to one.  At this period the earth sloped<br>
        downwards; the light took a uniform tint.  We were at a depth of a<br>
        hundred and five yards and twenty inches, undergoing a pressure of six<br>
        atmospheres.<br>
        <br>
        At this depth I could still see the rays of the sun, though feebly; to<br>
        their intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight, the lowest<br>
        state between day and night; but we could still see well enough; it was<br>
        not necessary to resort to the Ruhmkorff apparatus as yet.  At this<br>
        moment Captain Nemo stopped; he waited till I joined him, and then<br>
        pointed to an obscure mass, looming in the shadow, at a short distance.<br>
        <br>
        "It is the forest of the Island of Crespo," thought I; and I was not<br>
        mistaken.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XVI<br>
        <br>
        A SUBMARINE FOREST<br>
        <br>
        We had at last arrived on the borders of this forest, doubtless one of<br>
        the finest of Captain Nemo's immense domains.  He looked upon it as his<br>
        own, and considered he had the same right over it that the first men<br>
        had in the first days of the world.  And, indeed, who would have<br>
        disputed with him the possession of this submarine property?  What<br>
        other hardier pioneer would come, hatchet in hand, to cut down the dark<br>
        copses?<br>
        <br>
        This forest was composed of large tree-plants; and the moment we<br>
        <a href=../site4/page4_1385.html>internal_link4_text</a><br><br>
        penetrated under its vast arcades, I was struck by the singular<br>
        position of their branches--a position I had not yet observed.<br>
        <br>
        Not an herb which carpeted the ground, not a branch which clothed the<br>
        trees, was either broken or bent, nor did they extend horizontally; all<br>
        stretched up to the surface of the ocean.  Not a filament, not a<br>
        ribbon, however thin they might be, but kept as straight as a rod of<br>
        iron.  The fuci and llianas grew in rigid perpendicular lines, due to<br>
        the density of the element which had produced them.  Motionless yet,<br>
        when bent to one side by the hand, they directly resumed their former<br>
        position.  Truly it was the region of perpendicularity!<br>
        <br>
        I soon accustomed myself to this fantastic position, as well as to the<br>
        comparative darkness which surrounded us.  The soil of the forest<br>
        seemed covered with sharp blocks, difficult to avoid.  The submarine<br>
        flora struck me as being very perfect, and richer even than it would<br>
        have been in the arctic or tropical zones, where these productions are<br>
        not so plentiful.  But for some minutes I involuntarily confounded the<br>
        genera, taking animals for plants; and who would not have been<br>
        mistaken?  The fauna and the flora are too closely allied in this<br>
        submarine world.<br>
        <br>
        These plants are self-propagated, and the principle of their existence<br>
        is in the water, which upholds and nourishes them.  The greater number,<br>
        instead of leaves, shoot forth blades of capricious shapes, comprised<br>
        within a scale of colours pink, carmine, green, olive, fawn, and brown.<br>
        <br>
        "Curious anomaly, fantastic element!" said an ingenious naturalist, "in<br>
        which the animal kingdom blossoms, and the vegetable does not!"<br>
        <br>
        In about an hour Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt; I, for my part,<br>
        was not sorry, and we stretched ourselves under an arbour of alariae,<br>
        the long thin blades of which stood up like arrows.<br>
        <br>
        This short rest seemed delicious to me; there was nothing wanting but<br>
        the charm of conversation; but, impossible to speak, impossible to<br>
        answer, I only put my great copper head to Conseil's.  I saw the worthy<br>
        fellow's eyes glistening with delight, and, to show his satisfaction,<br>
        he shook himself in his breastplate of air, in the most comical way in<br>
        the world.<br>
        <br>
        After four hours of this walking, I was surprised not to find myself<br>
        dreadfully hungry.  How to account for this state of the stomach I<br>
        could not tell.  But instead I felt an insurmountable desire to sleep,<br>
        which happens to all divers.  And my eyes soon closed behind the thick<br>
        glasses, and I fell into a heavy slumber, which the movement alone had<br>
        prevented before.  Captain Nemo and his robust companion, stretched in<br>
        the clear crystal, set us the example.<br>
        <br>
        How long I remained buried in this drowsiness I cannot judge, but, when<br>
        I woke, the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon.  Captain Nemo had<br>
        already risen, and I was beginning to stretch my limbs, when an<br>
        unexpected apparition brought me briskly to my feet.<br>
        <br>
        A few steps off, a monstrous sea-spider, about thirty-eight inches<br>
        high, was watching me with squinting eyes, ready to spring upon me.<br>
        Though my diver's dress was thick enough to defend me from the bite of<br>
        this animal, I could not help shuddering with horror.  Conseil and the<br>
        sailor of the Nautilus awoke at this moment.  Captain Nemo pointed out<br>
        the hideous crustacean, which a blow from the butt end of the gun<br>
        knocked over, and I saw the horrible claws of the monster writhe in<br>
        terrible convulsions.  This incident reminded me that other animals<br>
        more to be feared might haunt these obscure depths, against whose<br>
        attacks my diving-dress would not protect me.  I had never thought of<br>
        it before, but I now resolved to be upon my guard.  Indeed, I thought<br>
        that this halt would mark the termination of our walk; but I was<br>
        mistaken, for, instead of returning to the Nautilus, Captain Nemo<br>
        continued his bold excursion.  The ground was still on the incline, its<br>
        declivity seemed to be getting greater, and to be leading us to greater<br>
        depths.  It must have been about three o'clock when we reached a narrow<br>
        valley, between high perpendicular walls, situated about seventy-five<br>
        fathoms deep.  Thanks to the perfection of our apparatus, we were<br>
        forty-five fathoms below the limit which nature seems to have imposed<br>
        on man as to his submarine excursions.<br>
        <br>
        I say seventy-five fathoms, though I had no instrument by which to<br>
        judge the distance.  But I knew that even in the clearest waters the<br>
        solar rays could not penetrate further.  And accordingly the darkness<br>
        deepened.  At ten paces not an object was visible.  I was groping my<br>
        way, when I suddenly saw a brilliant white light.  Captain Nemo had<br>
        just put his electric apparatus into use; his companion did the same,<br>
        and Conseil and I followed their example.  By turning a screw I<br>
        established a communication between the wire and the spiral glass, and<br>
        the sea, lit by our four lanterns, was illuminated for a circle of<br>
        thirty-six yards.<br>
        <br>
        As we walked I thought the light of our Ruhmkorff apparatus could not<br>
        fail to draw some inhabitant from its dark couch.  But if they did<br>
        approach us, they at least kept at a respectful distance from the<br>
        hunters.  Several times I saw Captain Nemo stop, put his gun to his<br>
        shoulder, and after some moments drop it and walk on.  At last, after<br>
        about four hours, this marvellous excursion came to an end.  A wall of<br>
        superb rocks, in an imposing mass, rose before us, a heap of gigantic<br>
        blocks, an enormous, steep granite shore, forming dark grottos, but<br>
        which presented no practicable slope; it was the prop of the Island of<br>
        Crespo.  It was the earth!  Captain Nemo stopped suddenly.  A gesture<br>
        of his brought us all to a halt; and, however desirous I might be to<br>
        scale the wall, I was obliged to stop.  Here ended Captain Nemo's<br>
        domains.  And he would not go beyond them.  Further on was a portion of<br>
        the globe he might not trample upon.<br>
        <br>
        The return began.  Captain Nemo had returned to the head of his little<br>
        band, directing their course without hesitation.  I thought we were not<br>
        following the same road to return to the Nautilus.  The new road was<br>
        very steep, and consequently very painful.  We approached the surface<br>
        of the sea rapidly.  But this return to the upper strata was not so<br>
        sudden as to cause relief from the pressure too rapidly, which might<br>
        have produced serious disorder in our organisation, and brought on<br>
        internal lesions, so fatal to divers.  Very soon light reappeared and<br>
        grew, and, the sun being low on the horizon, the refraction edged the<br>
        different objects with a spectral ring.  At ten yards and a half deep,<br>
        we walked amidst a shoal of little fishes of all kinds, more numerous<br>
        than the birds of the air, and also more agile; but no aquatic game<br>
        worthy of a shot had as yet met our gaze, when at that moment I saw the<br>
        Captain shoulder his gun quickly, and follow a moving object into the<br>
        shrubs.  He fired; I heard a slight hissing, and a creature fell<br>
        stunned at some distance from us.  It was a magnificent sea-otter, an<br>
        enhydrus, the only exclusively marine quadruped.  This otter was five<br>
        feet long, and must have been very valuable.  Its skin, chestnut-brown<br>
        above and silvery underneath, would have made one of those beautiful<br>
        furs so sought after in the Russian and Chinese markets: the fineness<br>
        and the lustre of its coat would certainly fetch L80.  I admired this<br>
        curious mammal, with its rounded head ornamented with short ears, its<br>
        round eyes, and white whiskers like those of a cat, with webbed feet<br>
        and nails, and tufted tail.  This precious animal, hunted and tracked<br>
        by fishermen, has now become very rare, and taken refuge chiefly in the<br>
        northern parts of the Pacific, or probably its race would soon become<br>
        extinct.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo's companion took the beast, threw it over his shoulder,<br>
        and we continued our journey.  For one hour a plain of sand lay<br>
        stretched before us.  Sometimes it rose to within two yards and some<br>
        inches of the surface of the water.  I then saw our image clearly<br>
        reflected, drawn inversely, and above us appeared an identical group<br>
        reflecting our movements and our actions; in a word, like us in every<br>
        point, except that they walked with their heads downward and their feet<br>
        in the air.<br>
        <br>
        Another effect I noticed, which was the passage of thick clouds which<br>
        formed and vanished rapidly; but on reflection I understood that these<br>
        seeming clouds were due to the varying thickness of the reeds at the<br>
        bottom, and I could even see the fleecy foam which their broken tops<br>
        multiplied on the water, and the shadows of large birds passing above<br>
        our heads, whose rapid flight I could discern on the surface of the sea.<br>
        <br>
        On this occasion I was witness to one of the finest gun shots which<br>
        ever made the nerves of a hunter thrill.  A large bird of great breadth<br>
        of wing, clearly visible, approached, hovering over us.  Captain Nemo's<br>
        companion shouldered his gun and fired, when it was only a few yards<br>
        above the waves.  The creature fell stunned, and the force of its fall<br>
        brought it within the reach of dexterous hunter's grasp.  It was an<br>
        albatross of the finest kind.<br>
        <br>
        Our march had not been interrupted by this incident.  For two hours we<br>
        followed these sandy plains, then fields of algae very disagreeable to<br>
        cross.  Candidly, I could do no more when I saw a glimmer of light,<br>
        which, for a half mile, broke the darkness of the waters.  It was the<br>
        lantern of the Nautilus.  Before twenty minutes were over we should be<br>
        on board, and I should be able to breathe with ease, for it seemed that<br>
        my reservoir supplied air very deficient in oxygen.  But I did not<br>
        reckon on an accidental meeting which delayed our arrival for some time.<br>
        <br>
        I had remained some steps behind, when I presently saw Captain Nemo<br>
        coming hurriedly towards me.  With his strong hand he bent me to the<br>
        ground, his companion doing the same to Conseil.  At first I knew not<br>
        what to think of this sudden attack, but I was soon reassured by seeing<br>
        the Captain lie down beside me, and remain immovable.<br>
        <br>
        I was stretched on the ground, just under the shelter of a bush of<br>
        algae, when, raising my head, I saw some enormous mass, casting<br>
        phosphorescent gleams, pass blusteringly by.<br>
        <br>
        My blood froze in my veins as I recognised two formidable sharks which<br>
        threatened us.  It was a couple of tintoreas, terrible creatures, with<br>
        enormous tails and a dull glassy stare, the phosphorescent matter<br>
        ejected from holes pierced around the muzzle.  Monstrous brutes! which<br>
        would crush a whole man in their iron jaws.  I did not know whether<br>
        Conseil stopped to classify them; for my part, I noticed their silver<br>
        bellies, and their huge mouths bristling with teeth, from a very<br>
        unscientific point of view, and more as a possible victim than as a<br>
        naturalist.<br>
        <br>
        Happily the voracious creatures do not see well.  They passed without<br>
        seeing us, brushing us with their brownish fins, and we escaped by a<br>
        miracle from a danger certainly greater than meeting a tiger full-face<br>
        in the forest.  Half an hour after, guided by the electric light we<br>
        reached the Nautilus.  The outside door had been left open, and Captain<br>
        Nemo closed it as soon as we had entered the first cell.  He then<br>
        pressed a knob.  I heard the pumps working in the midst of the vessel,<br>
        I felt the water sinking from around me, and in a few moments the cell<br>
        was entirely empty.  The inside door then opened, and we entered the<br>
        vestry.<br>
        <br>
        There our diving-dress was taken off, not without some trouble, and,<br>
        fairly worn out from want of food and sleep, I returned to my room, in<br>
        great wonder at this surprising excursion at the bottom of the sea.<br>

        CHAPTER XVII<br>
        <br>
        FOUR THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE PACIFIC<br>
        <br>
        The next morning, the 18th of November, I had quite recovered from my<br>
        fatigues of the day before, and I went up on to the platform, just as<br>
        the second lieutenant was uttering his daily phrase.<br>
        <br>
        I was admiring the magnificent aspect of the ocean when Captain Nemo<br>
        appeared.  He did not seem to be aware of my presence, and began a<br>
        series of astronomical observations.  Then, when he had finished, he<br>
        went and leant on the cage of the watch-light, and gazed abstractedly<br>
        on the ocean.  In the meantime, a number of the sailors of the<br>
        Nautilus, all strong and healthy men, had come up onto the platform.<br>
        They came to draw up the nets that had been laid all night.  These<br>
        sailors were evidently of different nations, although the European type<br>
        was visible in all of them.  I recognised some unmistakable Irishmen,<br>
        Frenchmen, some Sclaves, and a Greek, or a Candiote.  They were civil,<br>
        and only used that odd language among themselves, the origin of which I<br>
        could not guess, neither could I question them.<br>
        <br>
        The nets were hauled in.  They were a large kind of "chaluts," like<br>
        those on the Normandy coasts, great pockets that the waves and a chain<br>
        fixed in the smaller meshes kept open.  These pockets, drawn by iron<br>
        poles, swept through the water, and gathered in everything in their<br>
        way.  That day they brought up curious specimens from those productive<br>
        coasts.<br>
        <br>
        I reckoned that the haul had brought in more than nine hundredweight of<br>
        fish.  It was a fine haul, but not to be wondered at.  Indeed, the nets<br>
        are let down for several hours, and enclose in their meshes an infinite<br>
        variety.  We had no lack of excellent food, and the rapidity of the<br>
        Nautilus and the attraction of the electric light could always renew<br>
        our supply.  These several productions of the sea were immediately<br>
        lowered through the panel to the steward's room, some to be eaten<br>
        fresh, and others pickled.<br>
        <br>
        The fishing ended, the provision of air renewed, I thought that the<br>
        Nautilus was about to continue its submarine excursion, and was<br>
        preparing to return to my room, when, without further preamble, the<br>
        Captain turned to me, saying:<br>
        <br>
        "Professor, is not this ocean gifted with real life?  It has its<br>
        tempers and its gentle moods.  Yesterday it slept as we did, and now it<br>
        has woke after a quiet night.  Look!" he continued, "it wakes under the<br>
        caresses of the sun.  It is going to renew its diurnal existence.  It<br>
        is an interesting study to watch the play of its organisation.  It has<br>
        a pulse, arteries, spasms; and I agree with the learned Maury, who<br>
        discovered in it a circulation as real as the circulation of blood in<br>
        animals.<br>
