        "Well, Captain, what the ancients dared not undertake, this junction<br>
        between the two seas, which will shorten the road from Cadiz to India,<br>
        M. Lesseps has succeeded in doing; and before long he will have changed<br>
        Africa into an immense island."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, M. Aronnax; you have the right to be proud of your countryman.<br>
        Such a man brings more honour to a nation than great captains.  He<br>
        began, like so many others, with disgust and rebuffs; but he has<br>
        triumphed, for he has the genius of will.  And it is sad to think that<br>
        a work like that, which ought to have been an international work and<br>
        which would have sufficed to make a reign illustrious, should have<br>
        succeeded by the energy of one man.  All honour to M. Lesseps!"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes! honour to the great citizen," I replied, surprised by the manner<br>
        in which Captain Nemo had just spoken.<br>
        <br>
        "Unfortunately," he continued, "I cannot take you through the Suez<br>
        Canal; but you will be able to see the long jetty of Port Said after<br>
        to-morrow, when we shall be in the Mediterranean."<br>
        <br>
        "The Mediterranean!"  I exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir; does that astonish you?"<br>
        <br>
        "What astonishes me is to think that we shall be there the day after<br>
        to-morrow."<br>
        <br>
        "Indeed?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Captain, although by this time I ought to have accustomed myself<br>
        to be surprised at nothing since I have been on board your boat."<br>
        <br>
        "But the cause of this surprise?"<br>
        <br>
        "Well! it is the fearful speed you will have to put on the Nautilus, if<br>
        the day after to-morrow she is to be in the Mediterranean, having made<br>
        the round of Africa, and doubled the Cape of Good Hope!"<br>
        <br>
        "Who told you that she would make the round of Africa and double the<br>
        Cape of Good Hope, sir?"<br>
        <br>
        "Well, unless the Nautilus sails on dry land, and passes above the<br>
        isthmus----"<br>
        <br>
        "Or beneath it, M. Aronnax."<br>
        <br>
        "Beneath it?"<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly," replied Captain Nemo quietly.  "A long time ago Nature<br>
        made under this tongue of land what man has this day made on its<br>
        surface."<br>
        <br>
        "What! such a passage exists?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes; a subterranean passage, which I have named the Arabian Tunnel.<br>
        It takes us beneath Suez and opens into the Gulf of Pelusium."<br>
        <br>
        "But this isthmus is composed of nothing but quick sands?"<br>
        <br>
        "To a certain depth.  But at fifty-five yards only there is a solid<br>
        layer of rock."<br>
        <br>
        "Did you discover this passage by chance?"  I asked more and more<br>
        surprised.<br>
        <br>
        "Chance and reasoning, sir; and by reasoning even more than by chance.<br>
        Not only does this passage exist, but I have profited by it several<br>
        times.  Without that I should not have ventured this day into the<br>
        impassable Red Sea.  I noticed that in the Red Sea and in the<br>
        Mediterranean there existed a certain number of fishes of a kind<br>
        perfectly identical.  Certain of the fact, I asked myself was it<br>
        possible that there was no communication between the two seas?  If<br>
        there was, the subterranean current must necessarily run from the Red<br>
        Sea to the Mediterranean, from the sole cause of difference of level.<br>
        I caught a large number of fishes in the neighbourhood of Suez.  I<br>
        passed a copper ring through their tails, and threw them back into the<br>
        sea.  Some months later, on the coast of Syria, I caught some of my<br>
        fish ornamented with the ring.  Thus the communication between the two<br>
        was proved.  I then sought for it with my Nautilus; I discovered it,<br>
        ventured into it, and before long, sir, you too will have passed<br>
        through my Arabian tunnel!"<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER V<br>
        <br>
        THE ARABIAN TUNNEL<br>
        <br>
        That same evening, in 21Â° 30' N. lat., the Nautilus floated on the<br>
        surface of the sea, approaching the Arabian coast.  I saw Djeddah, the<br>
        most important counting-house of Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and India.  I<br>
        distinguished clearly enough its buildings, the vessels anchored at the<br>
        quays, and those whose draught of water obliged them to anchor in the<br>
        roads.  The sun, rather low on the horizon, struck full on the houses<br>
        of the town, bringing out their whiteness.  Outside, some wooden<br>
        cabins, and some made of reeds, showed the quarter inhabited by the<br>
        Bedouins.  Soon Djeddah was shut out from view by the shadows of night,<br>
        and the Nautilus found herself under water slightly phosphorescent.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 10th of February, we sighted several ships running to<br>
        windward.  The Nautilus returned to its submarine navigation; but at<br>
        noon, when her bearings were taken, the sea being deserted, she rose<br>
        again to her waterline.<br>
        <br>
        Accompanied by Ned and Conseil, I seated myself on the platform.  The<br>
        coast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a<br>
        damp fog.<br>
        <br>
        We were leaning on the sides of the pinnace, talking of one thing and<br>
        another, when Ned Land, stretching out his hand towards a spot on the<br>
        sea, said:<br>
        <br>
        "Do you see anything there, sir?"<br>
        <br>
        "No, Ned," I replied; "but I have not your eyes, you know."<br>
        <br>
        "Look well," said Ned, "there, on the starboard beam, about the height<br>
        of the lantern!  Do you not see a mass which seems to move?"<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly," said I, after close attention; "I see something like a<br>
        long black body on the top of the water."<br>
        <br>
        And certainly before long the black object was not more than a mile<br>
        from us.  It looked like a great sandbank deposited in the open sea.<br>
        It was a gigantic dugong!<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land looked eagerly.  His eyes shone with covetousness at the sight<br>
        of the animal.  His hand seemed ready to harpoon it.  One would have<br>
        thought he was awaiting the moment to throw himself into the sea and<br>
        attack it in its element.<br>
        <br>
        At this instant Captain Nemo appeared on the platform.  He saw the<br>
        dugong, understood the Canadian's attitude, and, addressing him, said:<br>
        <br>
        "If you held a harpoon just now, Master Land, would it not burn your<br>
        hand?"<br>
        <br>
        "Just so, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "And you would not be sorry to go back, for one day, to your trade of a<br>
        fisherman and to add this cetacean to the list of those you have<br>
        already killed?"<br>
        <br>
        "I should not, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, you can try."<br>
        <br>
        "Thank you, sir," said Ned Land, his eyes flaming.<br>
        <br>
        "Only," continued the Captain, "I advise you for your own sake not to<br>
        miss the creature."<br>
        <br>
        "Is the dugong dangerous to attack?"  I asked, in spite of the<br>
        Canadian's shrug of the shoulders.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," replied the Captain; "sometimes the animal turns upon its<br>
        assailants and overturns their boat.  But for Master Land this danger<br>
        is not to be feared.  His eye is prompt, his arm sure."<br>
        <br>
        At this moment seven men of the crew, mute and immovable as ever,<br>
        mounted the platform.  One carried a harpoon and a line similar to<br>
        those employed in catching whales.  The pinnace was lifted from the<br>
        bridge, pulled from its socket, and let down into the sea.  Six oarsmen<br>
        took their seats, and the coxswain went to the tiller.  Ned, Conseil,<br>
        and I went to the back of the boat.<br>
        <br>
        "You are not coming, Captain?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir; but I wish you good sport."<br>
        <br>
        The boat put off, and, lifted by the six rowers, drew rapidly towards<br>
        the dugong, which floated about two miles from the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        Arrived some cables-length from the cetacean, the speed slackened, and<br>
        the oars dipped noiselessly into the quiet waters.  Ned Land, harpoon<br>
        in hand, stood in the fore part of the boat.  The harpoon used for<br>
        striking the whale is generally attached to a very long cord which runs<br>
        out rapidly as the wounded creature draws it after him.  But here the<br>
        cord was not more than ten fathoms long, and the extremity was attached<br>
        to a small barrel which, by floating, was to show the course the dugong<br>
        took under the water.<br>
        <br>
        I stood and carefully watched the Canadian's adversary.  This dugong,<br>
        which also bears the name of the halicore, closely resembles the<br>
        manatee; its oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail, and its<br>
        lateral fins in perfect fingers.  Its difference from the manatee<br>
        consisted in its upper jaw, which was armed with two long and pointed<br>
        teeth which formed on each side diverging tusks.<br>
        <br>
        This dugong which Ned Land was preparing to attack was of colossal<br>
        dimensions; it was more than seven yards long.  It did not move, and<br>
        seemed to be sleeping on the waves, which circumstance made it easier<br>
        to capture.<br>
        <br>
        The boat approached within six yards of the animal.  The oars rested on<br>
        the rowlocks.  I half rose.  Ned Land, his body thrown a little back,<br>
        brandished the harpoon in his experienced hand.<br>
        <br>
        Suddenly a hissing noise was heard, and the dugong disappeared.  The<br>
        harpoon, although thrown with great force; had apparently only struck<br>
        the water.<br>
        <br>
        "Curse it!" exclaimed the Canadian furiously; "I have missed it!"<br>
        <br>
        "No," said I; "the creature is wounded--look at the blood; but your<br>
        weapon has not stuck in his body."<br>
        <br>
        "My harpoon! my harpoon!" cried Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        The sailors rowed on, and the coxswain made for the floating barrel.<br>
        The harpoon regained, we followed in pursuit of the animal.<br>
        <br>
        The latter came now and then to the surface to breathe.  Its wound had<br>
        not weakened it, for it shot onwards with great rapidity.<br>
        <br>
        The boat, rowed by strong arms, flew on its track.  Several times it<br>
        approached within some few yards, and the Canadian was ready to strike,<br>
        but the dugong made off with a sudden plunge, and it was impossible to<br>
        reach it.<br>
        <br>
        Imagine the passion which excited impatient Ned Land!  He hurled at the<br>
        unfortunate creature the most energetic expletives in the English<br>
        tongue.  For my part, I was only vexed to see the dugong escape all our<br>
        attacks.<br>
        <br>
        We pursued it without relaxation for an hour, and I began to think it<br>
        would prove difficult to capture, when the animal, possessed with the<br>
        perverse idea of vengeance of which he had cause to repent, turned upon<br>
        the pinnace and assailed us in its turn.<br>
        <br>
        This manoeuvre did not escape the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Look out!" he cried.<br>
        <br>
        The coxswain said some words in his outlandish tongue, doubtless<br>
        warning the men to keep on their guard.<br>
        <br>
        The dugong came within twenty feet of the boat, stopped, sniffed the<br>
        air briskly with its large nostrils (not pierced at the extremity, but<br>
        in the upper part of its muzzle). Then, taking a spring, he threw<br>
        himself upon us.<br>
        <br>
        The pinnace could not avoid the shock, and half upset, shipped at least<br>
        two tons of water, which had to be emptied; but, thanks to the<br>
        coxswain, we caught it sideways, not full front, so we were not quite<br>
        overturned.  While Ned Land, clinging to the bows, belaboured the<br>
        gigantic animal with blows from his harpoon, the creature's teeth were<br>
        buried in the gunwale, and it lifted the whole thing out of the water,<br>
        as a lion does a roebuck.  We were upset over one another, and I know<br>
        not how the adventure would have ended, if the Canadian, still enraged<br>
        with the beast, had not struck it to the heart.<br>
        <br>
        I heard its teeth grind on the iron plate, and the dugong disappeared,<br>
        carrying the harpoon with him.  But the barrel soon returned to the<br>
        surface, and shortly after the body of the animal, turned on its back.<br>
        The boat came up with it, took it in tow, and made straight for the<br>
        Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        It required tackle of enormous strength to hoist the dugong on to the<br>
        platform.  It weighed 10,000 lb.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, 11th February, the larder of the Nautilus was enriched by<br>
        some more delicate game.  A flight of sea-swallows rested on the<br>
        Nautilus.  It was a species of the Sterna nilotica, peculiar to Egypt;<br>
        its beak is black, head grey and pointed, the eye surrounded by white<br>
        spots, the back, wings, and tail of a greyish colour, the belly and<br>
        throat white, and claws red.  They also took some dozen of Nile ducks,<br>
        a wild bird of high flavour, its throat and upper part of the head<br>
        white with black spots.<br>
        <br>
        About five o'clock in the evening we sighted to the north the Cape of<br>
        Ras-Mohammed. This cape forms the extremity of Arabia Petraea,<br>
        comprised between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Acabah.<br>
        <br>
        The Nautilus penetrated into the Straits of Jubal, which leads to the<br>
        Gulf of Suez.  I distinctly saw a high mountain, towering between the<br>
        two gulfs of Ras-Mohammed. It was Mount Horeb, that Sinai at the top of<br>
        which Moses saw God face to face.<br>
        <br>
        At six o'clock the Nautilus, sometimes floating, sometimes immersed,<br>
        passed some distance from Tor, situated at the end of the bay, the<br>
        waters of which seemed tinted with red, an observation already made by<br>
        Captain Nemo.  Then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence,<br>
        sometimes broken by the cries of the pelican and other night-birds, and<br>
        the noise of the waves breaking upon the shore, chafing against the<br>
        rocks, or the panting of some far-off steamer beating the waters of the<br>
        Gulf with its noisy paddles.<br>
        <br>
        From eight to nine o'clock the Nautilus remained some fathoms under the<br>
        water.  According to my calculation we must have been very near Suez.<br>
        Through the panel of the saloon I saw the bottom of the rocks<br>
        brilliantly lit up by our electric lamp.  We seemed to be leaving the<br>
        Straits behind us more and more.<br>
        <br>
        At a quarter-past nine, the vessel having returned to the surface, I<br>
        mounted the platform.  Most impatient to pass through Captain Nemo's<br>
        tunnel, I could not stay in one place, so came to breathe the fresh<br>
        night air.<br>
        <br>
        Soon in the shadow I saw a pale light, half discoloured by the fog,<br>
        shining about a mile from us.<br>
        <br>
        "A floating lighthouse!" said someone near me.<br>
        <br>
        I turned, and saw the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        "It is the floating light of Suez," he continued.  "It will not be long<br>
        before we gain the entrance of the tunnel."<br>
        <br>
        "The entrance cannot be easy?"<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir; for that reason I am accustomed to go into the steersman's<br>
        cage and myself direct our course.  And now, if you will go down, M.<br>
        Aronnax, the Nautilus is going under the waves, and will not return to<br>
        the surface until we have passed through the Arabian Tunnel."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo led me towards the central staircase; half way down he<br>
        opened a door, traversed the upper deck, and landed in the pilot's<br>
        cage, which it may be remembered rose at the extremity of the platform.<br>
        It was a cabin measuring six feet square, very much like that occupied<br>
        by the pilot on the steamboats of the Mississippi or Hudson.  In the<br>
        midst worked a wheel, placed vertically, and caught to the tiller-rope,<br>
        which ran to the back of the Nautilus.  Four light-ports with<br>
        lenticular glasses, let in a groove in the partition of the cabin,<br>
        allowed the man at the wheel to see in all directions.<br>
        <br>
        This cabin was dark; but soon my eyes accustomed themselves to the<br>
        obscurity, and I perceived the pilot, a strong man, with his hands<br>
        resting on the spokes of the wheel.  Outside, the sea appeared vividly<br>
        lit up by the lantern, which shed its rays from the back of the cabin<br>
        to the other extremity of the platform.<br>
        <a href=../site1/page1_9712.html>external_link0_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        "Now," said Captain Nemo, "let us try to make our passage."<br>
        <br>
        Electric wires connected the pilot's cage with the machinery room, and<br>
        from there the Captain could communicate simultaneously to his Nautilus<br>
        the direction and the speed.  He pressed a metal knob, and at once the<br>
        speed of the screw diminished.<br>
        <br>
        I looked in silence at the high straight wall we were running by at<br>
        this moment, the immovable base of a massive sandy coast.  We followed<br>
        it thus for an hour only some few yards off.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo did not take his eye from the knob, suspended by its two<br>
        concentric circles in the cabin.  At a simple gesture, the pilot<br>
        modified the course of the Nautilus every instant.<br>
        <br>
        I had placed myself at the port-scuttle, and saw some magnificent<br>
        substructures of coral, zoophytes, seaweed, and fucus, agitating their<br>
        enormous claws, which stretched out from the fissures of the rock.<br>
        <br>
        At a quarter-past ten, the Captain himself took the helm.  A large<br>
        gallery, black and deep, opened before us.  The Nautilus went boldly<br>
        into it.  A strange roaring was heard round its sides.  It was the<br>
        waters of the Red Sea, which the incline of the tunnel precipitated<br>
        violently towards the Mediterranean.  The Nautilus went with the<br>
        torrent, rapid as an arrow, in spite of the efforts of the machinery,<br>
        which, in order to offer more effective resistance, beat the waves with<br>
        reversed screw.<br>
        <br>
        On the walls of the narrow passage I could see nothing but brilliant<br>
        rays, straight lines, furrows of fire, traced by the great speed, under<br>
        the brilliant electric light.  My heart beat fast.<br>
        <br>
        At thirty-five minutes past ten, Captain Nemo quitted the helm, and,<br>
        turning to me, said:<br>
        <br>
        "The Mediterranean!"<br>
        <br>
        In less than twenty minutes, the Nautilus, carried along by the<br>
        torrent, had passed through the Isthmus of Suez.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER VI<br>
        <br>
        THE GRECIAN ARCHIPELAGO<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 12th of February, at the dawn of day, the Nautilus<br>
        rose to the surface.  I hastened on to the platform.  Three miles to<br>
        the south the dim outline of Pelusium was to be seen.  A torrent had<br>
        carried us from one sea to another.  About seven o'clock Ned and<br>
        Conseil joined me.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Sir Naturalist," said the Canadian, in a slightly jovial tone,<br>
        "and the Mediterranean?"<br>
        <br>
        "We are floating on its surface, friend Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "What!" said Conseil, "this very night."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, this very night; in a few minutes we have passed this impassable<br>
        isthmus."<br>
        <br>
        "I do not believe it," replied the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Then you are wrong, Master Land," I continued; "this low coast which<br>
        rounds off to the south is the Egyptian coast.  And you who have such<br>
        good eyes, Ned, you can see the jetty of Port Said stretching into the<br>
        sea."<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian looked attentively.<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly you are right, sir, and your Captain is a first-rate man.<br>
        We are in the Mediterranean.  Good!  Now, if you please, let us talk of<br>
        our own little affair, but so that no one hears us."<br>
        <br>
        I saw what the Canadian wanted, and, in any case, I thought it better<br>
        to let him talk, as he wished it; so we all three went and sat down<br>
        near the lantern, where we were less exposed to the spray of the blades.<br>
        <br>
        "Now, Ned, we listen; what have you to tell us?"<br>
        <br>
        "What I have to tell you is very simple.  We are in Europe; and before<br>
        Captain Nemo's caprices drag us once more to the bottom of the Polar<br>
        Seas, or lead us into Oceania, I ask to leave the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        I wished in no way to shackle the liberty of my companions, but I<br>
        certainly felt no desire to leave Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        Thanks to him, and thanks to his apparatus, I was each day nearer the<br>
        completion of my submarine studies; and I was rewriting my book of<br>
        submarine depths in its very element.  Should I ever again have such an<br>
        opportunity of observing the wonders of the ocean?  No, certainly not!<br>
        And I could not bring myself to the idea of abandoning the Nautilus<br>
        before the cycle of investigation was accomplished.<br>
        <br>
        "Friend Ned, answer me frankly, are you tired of being on board?  Are<br>
        you sorry that destiny has thrown us into Captain Nemo's hands?"<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian remained some moments without answering.  Then, crossing<br>
        his arms, he said:<br>
        <br>
        "Frankly, I do not regret this journey under the seas.  I shall be glad<br>
        to have made it; but, now that it is made, let us have done with it.<br>
        That is my idea."<br>
        <br>
        "It will come to an end, Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "Where and when?"<br>
        <br>
        "Where I do not know--when I cannot say; or, rather, I suppose it will<br>
        end when these seas have nothing more to teach us."<br>
        <br>
        "Then what do you hope for?" demanded the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "That circumstances may occur as well six months hence as now by which<br>
        we may and ought to profit."<br>
        <br>
        "Oh!" said Ned Land, "and where shall we be in six months, if you<br>
        please, Sir Naturalist?"<br>
        <br>
        "Perhaps in China; you know the Nautilus is a rapid traveller.  It goes<br>
        through water as swallows through the air, or as an express on the<br>
        land.  It does not fear frequented seas; who can say that it may not<br>
        beat the coasts of France, England, or America, on which flight may be<br>
        attempted as advantageously as here."<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax," replied the Canadian, "your arguments are rotten at the<br>
        foundation.  You speak in the future, `We shall be there!  we shall be<br>
        here!'  I speak in the present, `We are here, and we must profit by<br>
        it.'"<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land's logic pressed me hard, and I felt myself beaten on that<br>
        ground.  I knew not what argument would now tell in my favour.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," continued Ned, "let us suppose an impossibility: if Captain Nemo<br>
        should this day offer you your liberty; would you accept it?"<br>
        <br>
        "I do not know," I answered.<br>
        <br>
        "And if," he added, "the offer made you this day was never to be<br>
        renewed, would you accept it?"<br>
        <br>
        "Friend Ned, this is my answer.  Your reasoning is against me.  We must<br>
        not rely on Captain Nemo's good-will. Common prudence forbids him to<br>
        set us at liberty.  On the other side, prudence bids us profit by the<br>
        first opportunity to leave the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, M. Aronnax, that is wisely said."<br>
        <br>
        "Only one observation--just one.  The occasion must be serious, and our<br>
        first attempt must succeed; if it fails, we shall never find another,<br>
        and Captain Nemo will never forgive us."<br>
        <br>
        "All that is true," replied the Canadian.  "But your observation<br>
        applies equally to all attempts at flight, whether in two years' time,<br>
        or in two days'. But the question is still this: If a favourable<br>
        opportunity presents itself, it must be seized."<br>
        <br>
        "Agreed!  And now, Ned, will you tell me what you mean by a favourable<br>
        opportunity?"<br>
        <br>
        "It will be that which, on a dark night, will bring the Nautilus a<br>
        short distance from some European coast."<br>
        <br>
        "And you will try and save yourself by swimming?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, if we were near enough to the bank, and if the vessel was<br>
        floating at the time.  Not if the bank was far away, and the boat was<br>
        under the water."<br>
        <br>
        "And in that case?"<br>
        <br>
        "In that case, I should seek to make myself master of the pinnace.  I<br>
        know how it is worked.  We must get inside, and the bolts once drawn,<br>
        we shall come to the surface of the water, without even the pilot, who<br>
        is in the bows, perceiving our flight."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Ned, watch for the opportunity; but do not forget that a hitch<br>
        will ruin us."<br>
        <br>
        "I will not forget, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "And now, Ned, would you like to know what I think of your project?"<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly, M. Aronnax."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, I think--I do not say I hope--I think that this favourable<br>
        opportunity will never present itself."<br>
        <br>
        "Why not?"<br>
        <br>
        "Because Captain Nemo cannot hide from himself that we have not given<br>
        up all hope of regaining our liberty, and he will be on his guard,<br>
        above all, in the seas and in the sight of European coasts."<br>
        <br>
        "We shall see," replied Ned Land, shaking his head determinedly.<br>
        <br>
        "And now, Ned Land," I added, "let us stop here.  Not another word on<br>
        the subject.  The day that you are ready, come and let us know, and we<br>
        will follow you.  I rely entirely upon you."<br>
        <br>
        Thus ended a conversation which, at no very distant time, led to such<br>
        grave results.  I must say here that facts seemed to confirm my<br>
        foresight, to the Canadian's great despair.  Did Captain Nemo distrust<br>
        us in these frequented seas? or did he only wish to hide himself from<br>
        the numerous vessels, of all nations, which ploughed the Mediterranean?<br>
        I could not tell; but we were oftener between waters and far from the<br>
        coast.  Or, if the Nautilus did emerge, nothing was to be seen but the<br>
        pilot's cage; and sometimes it went to great depths, for, between the<br>
        Grecian Archipelago and Asia Minor we could not touch the bottom by<br>
        more than a thousand fathoms.<br>
        <br>
        Thus I only knew we were near the Island of Carpathos, one of the<br>
        Sporades, by Captain Nemo reciting these lines from Virgil:<br>
        <br>
            "Est Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates,<br>
             Caeruleus Proteus,"<br>
        <br>
        as he pointed to a spot on the planisphere.<br>
        <br>
        It was indeed the ancient abode of Proteus, the old shepherd of<br>
        Neptune's flocks, now the Island of Scarpanto, situated between Rhodes<br>
        and Crete.  I saw nothing but the granite base through the glass panels<br>
        of the saloon.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 14th of February, I resolved to employ some hours in<br>
        studying the fishes of the Archipelago; but for some reason or other<br>
        the panels remained hermetically sealed.  Upon taking the course of the<br>
        Nautilus, I found that we were going towards Candia, the ancient Isle<br>
        of Crete.  At the time I embarked on the Abraham Lincoln, the whole of<br>
        this island had risen in insurrection against the despotism of the<br>
        Turks.  But how the insurgents had fared since that time I was<br>
        absolutely ignorant, and it was not Captain Nemo, deprived of all land<br>
        communications, who could tell me.<br>
        <br>
        I made no allusion to this event when that night I found myself alone<br>
        with him in the saloon.  Besides, he seemed to be taciturn and<br>
        preoccupied.  Then, contrary to his custom, he ordered both panels to<br>
        be opened, and, going from one to the other, observed the mass of<br>
        waters attentively.  To what end I could not guess; so, on my side, I<br>
        employed my time in studying the fish passing before my eyes.<br>
        <br>
        In the midst of the waters a man appeared, a diver, carrying at his<br>
        belt a leathern purse.  It was not a body abandoned to the waves; it<br>
        was a living man, swimming with a strong hand, disappearing<br>
        occasionally to take breath at the surface.<br>
        <br>
        I turned towards Captain Nemo, and in an agitated voice exclaimed:<br>
        <br>
        "A man shipwrecked!  He must be saved at any price!"<br>
        <br>
        The Captain did not answer me, but came and leaned against the panel.<br>
        <br>
        The man had approached, and, with his face flattened against the glass,<br>
        was looking at us.<br>
        <br>
        To my great amazement, Captain Nemo signed to him.  The diver answered<br>
        with his hand, mounted immediately to the surface of the water, and did<br>
        not appear again.<br>
        <br>
        "Do not be uncomfortable," said Captain Nemo.  "It is Nicholas of Cape<br>
        Matapan, surnamed Pesca.  He is well known in all the Cyclades.  A bold<br>
        diver! water is his element, and he lives more in it than on land,<br>
        going continually from one island to another, even as far as Crete."<br>
        <br>
        "You know him, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "Why not, M. Aronnax?"<br>
        <br>
        Saying which, Captain Nemo went towards a piece of furniture standing<br>
        near the left panel of the saloon.  Near this piece of furniture, I saw<br>
        a chest bound with iron, on the cover of which was a copper plate,<br>
        bearing the cypher of the Nautilus with its device.<br>
        <br>
        At that moment, the Captain, without noticing my presence, opened the<br>
        piece of furniture, a sort of strong box, which held a great many<br>
        ingots.<br>
        <br>
        They were ingots of gold.  From whence came this precious metal, which<br>
        represented an enormous sum?  Where did the Captain gather this gold<br>
        from? and what was he going to do with it?<br>
        <br>
        I did not say one word.  I looked.  Captain Nemo took the ingots one by<br>
        one, and arranged them methodically in the chest, which he filled<br>
        entirely.  I estimated the contents at more than 4,000 lb. weight of<br>
        gold, that is to say, nearly L200,000.<br>
        <br>
        The chest was securely fastened, and the Captain wrote an address on<br>
        the lid, in characters which must have belonged to Modern Greece.<br>
        <br>
        This done, Captain Nemo pressed a knob, the wire of which communicated<br>
        with the quarters of the crew.  Four men appeared, and, not without<br>
        some trouble, pushed the chest out of the saloon.  Then I heard them<br>
        hoisting it up the iron staircase by means of pulleys.<br>
        <br>
        At that moment, Captain Nemo turned to me.<br>
        <br>
        "And you were saying, sir?" said he.<br>
        <br>
        "I was saying nothing, Captain."<br>
        <br>
        "Then, sir, if you will allow me, I will wish you good night."<br>
        <br>
        Whereupon he turned and left the saloon.<br>
        <br>
        I returned to my room much troubled, as one may believe.  I vainly<br>
        tried to sleep--I sought the connecting link between the apparition of<br>
        the diver and the chest filled with gold.  Soon, I felt by certain<br>
        movements of pitching and tossing that the Nautilus was leaving the<br>
        depths and returning to the surface.<br>
        <br>
        Then I heard steps upon the platform; and I knew they were unfastening<br>
        the pinnace and launching it upon the waves.  For one instant it struck<br>
        the side of the Nautilus, then all noise ceased.<br>
        <br>
        Two hours after, the same noise, the same going and coming was renewed;<br>
        the boat was hoisted on board, replaced in its socket, and the Nautilus<br>
        again plunged under the waves.<br>
        <br>
        So these millions had been transported to their address.  To what point<br>
        of the continent?  Who was Captain Nemo's correspondent?<br>
        <br>
        The next day I related to Conseil and the Canadian the events of the<br>
        night, which had excited my curiosity to the highest degree.  My<br>
        companions were not less surprised than myself.<br>
        <br>
        "But where does he take his millions to?" asked Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        To that there was no possible answer.  I returned to the saloon after<br>
        having breakfast and set to work.  Till five o'clock in the evening I<br>
        <a href=../site4/page4_1385.html>internal_link1_text</a><br><br>
        employed myself in arranging my notes.  At that moment--(ought I to<br>
        attribute it to some peculiar idiosyncrasy)--I felt so great a heat<br>
        that I was obliged to take off my coat.  It was strange, for we were<br>
        under low latitudes; and even then the Nautilus, submerged as it was,<br>
        ought to experience no change of temperature.  I looked at the<br>
        manometer; it showed a depth of sixty feet, to which atmospheric heat<br>
        could never attain.<br>
        <br>
        I continued my work, but the temperature rose to such a pitch as to be<br>
        intolerable.<br>
        <br>
        "Could there be fire on board?"  I asked myself.<br>
        <br>
        I was leaving the saloon, when Captain Nemo entered; he approached the<br>
        thermometer, consulted it, and, turning to me, said:<br>
        <br>
        "Forty-two degrees."<br>
        <br>
        "I have noticed it, Captain," I replied; "and if it gets much hotter we<br>
        cannot bear it."<br>
        <br>
        "Oh, sir, it will not get better if we do not wish it."<br>
        <br>
        "You can reduce it as you please, then?"<br>
        <br>
        "No; but I can go farther from the stove which produces it."<br>
        <br>
        "It is outward, then!"<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly; we are floating in a current of boiling water."<br>
        <br>
        "Is it possible!"  I exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        "Look."<br>
        <br>
        The panels opened, and I saw the sea entirely white all round.  A<br>
        sulphurous smoke was curling amid the waves, which boiled like water in<br>
        a copper.  I placed my hand on one of the panes of glass, but the heat<br>
        was so great that I quickly took it off again.<br>
        <br>
        "Where are we?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Near the Island of Santorin, sir," replied the Captain.  "I wished to<br>
        give you a sight of the curious spectacle of a submarine eruption."<br>
        <br>
        "I thought," said I, "that the formation of these new islands was<br>
        ended."<br>
        <br>
        "Nothing is ever ended in the volcanic parts of the sea," replied<br>
        Captain Nemo; "and the globe is always being worked by subterranean<br>
        fires.  Already, in the nineteenth year of our era, according to<br>
        Cassiodorus and Pliny, a new island, Theia (the divine), appeared in<br>
        the very place where these islets have recently been formed.  Then they<br>
        sank under the waves, to rise again in the year 69, when they again<br>
        subsided.  Since that time to our days the Plutonian work has been<br>
        suspended.  But on the 3rd of February, 1866, a new island, which they<br>
        named George Island, emerged from the midst of the sulphurous vapour<br>
        near Nea Kamenni, and settled again the 6th of the same month.  Seven<br>
        days after, the 13th of February, the Island of Aphroessa appeared,<br>
        leaving between Nea Kamenni and itself a canal ten yards broad.  I was<br>
        in these seas when the phenomenon occurred, and I was able therefore to<br>
        observe all the different phases.  The Island of Aphroessa, of round<br>
        form, measured 300 feet in diameter, and 30 feet in height.  It was<br>
        composed of black and vitreous lava, mixed with fragments of felspar.<br>
        And lastly, on the 10th of March, a smaller island, called Reka, showed<br>
        itself near Nea Kamenni, and since then these three have joined<br>
        together, forming but one and the same island."<br>
        <br>
        "And the canal in which we are at this moment?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Here it is," replied Captain Nemo, showing me a map of the<br>
        Archipelago.  "You see, I have marked the new islands."<br>
        <br>
        I returned to the glass.  The Nautilus was no longer moving, the heat<br>
        was becoming unbearable.  The sea, which till now had been white, was<br>
        red, owing to the presence of salts of iron.  In spite of the ship's<br>
        being hermetically sealed, an insupportable smell of sulphur filled the<br>
        saloon, and the brilliancy of the electricity was entirely extinguished<br>
        by bright scarlet flames.  I was in a bath, I was choking, I was<br>
        broiled.<br>
        <br>
        "We can remain no longer in this boiling water," said I to the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        "It would not be prudent," replied the impassive Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        An order was given; the Nautilus tacked about and left the furnace it<br>
        could not brave with impunity.  A quarter of an hour after we were<br>
        breathing fresh air on the surface.  The thought then struck me that,<br>
        if Ned Land had chosen this part of the sea for our flight, we should<br>
        never have come alive out of this sea of fire.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 16th of February, we left the basin which, between<br>
        Rhodes and Alexandria, is reckoned about 1,500 fathoms in depth, and<br>
        the Nautilus, passing some distance from Cerigo, quitted the Grecian<br>
        Archipelago after having doubled Cape Matapan.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER VII<br>
        <br>
        THE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS<br>
        <br>
        The Mediterranean, the blue sea par excellence, "the great sea" of the<br>
        Hebrews, "the sea" of the Greeks, the "mare nostrum" of the Romans,<br>
        bordered by orange-trees, aloes, cacti, and sea-pines; embalmed with<br>
        the perfume of the myrtle, surrounded by rude mountains, saturated with<br>
        pure and transparent air, but incessantly worked by underground fires;<br>
        a perfect battlefield in which Neptune and Pluto still dispute the<br>
        empire of the world!<br>
        <br>
        It is upon these banks, and on these waters, says Michelet, that man is<br>
        renewed in one of the most powerful climates of the globe.  But,<br>
        beautiful as it was, I could only take a rapid glance at the basin<br>
        whose superficial area is two million of square yards.  Even Captain<br>
        Nemo's knowledge was lost to me, for this puzzling person did not<br>
        appear once during our passage at full speed.  I estimated the course<br>
        which the Nautilus took under the waves of the sea at about six hundred<br>
        leagues, and it was accomplished in forty-eight hours.  Starting on the<br>
        morning of the 16th of February from the shores of Greece, we had<br>
        crossed the Straits of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th.<br>
        <br>
        It was plain to me that this Mediterranean, enclosed in the midst of<br>
        those countries which he wished to avoid, was distasteful to Captain<br>
        Nemo.  Those waves and those breezes brought back too many<br>
        remembrances, if not too many regrets.  Here he had no longer that<br>
        independence and that liberty of gait which he had when in the open<br>
        seas, and his Nautilus felt itself cramped between the close shores of<br>
        Africa and Europe.<br>
        <br>
        Our speed was now twenty-five miles an hour.  It may be well understood<br>
        that Ned Land, to his great disgust, was obliged to renounce his<br>
        intended flight.  He could not launch the pinnace, going at the rate of<br>
        twelve or thirteen yards every second.  To quit the Nautilus under such<br>
        conditions would be as bad as jumping from a train going at full<br>
        speed--an imprudent thing, to say the least of it.  Besides, our vessel<br>
        only mounted to the surface of the waves at night to renew its stock of<br>
        air; it was steered entirely by the compass and the log.<br>
        <br>
        I saw no more of the interior of this Mediterranean than a traveller by<br>
        express train perceives of the landscape which flies before his eyes;<br>
        that is to say, the distant horizon, and not the nearer objects which<br>
        pass like a flash of lightning.<br>
        <br>
        We were then passing between Sicily and the coast of Tunis.  In the<br>
        narrow space between Cape Bon and the Straits of Messina the bottom of<br>
        the sea rose almost suddenly.  There was a perfect bank, on which there<br>
        was not more than nine fathoms of water, whilst on either side the<br>
        depth was ninety fathoms.<br>
        <br>
        The Nautilus had to manoeuvre very carefully so as not to strike<br>
        against this submarine barrier.<br>
        <br>
        I showed Conseil, on the map of the Mediterranean, the spot occupied by<br>
        this reef.<br>
        <br>
        "But if you please, sir," observed Conseil, "it is like a real isthmus<br>
        joining Europe to Africa."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, my boy, it forms a perfect bar to the Straits of Lybia, and the<br>
        soundings of Smith have proved that in former times the continents<br>
        between Cape Boco and Cape Furina were joined."<br>
        <br>
        "I can well believe it," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "I will add," I continued, "that a similar barrier exists between<br>
        Gibraltar and Ceuta, which in geological times formed the entire<br>
        Mediterranean."<br>
        <br>
        "What if some volcanic burst should one day raise these two barriers<br>
        above the waves?"<br>
        <br>
        "It is not probable, Conseil."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, but allow me to finish, please, sir; if this phenomenon should<br>
        take place, it will be troublesome for M. Lesseps, who has taken so<br>
        much pains to pierce the isthmus."<br>
        <br>
        "I agree with you; but I repeat, Conseil, this phenomenon will never<br>
        happen.  The violence of subterranean force is ever diminishing.<br>
        Volcanoes, so plentiful in the first days of the world, are being<br>
        extinguished by degrees; the internal heat is weakened, the temperature<br>
        of the lower strata of the globe is lowered by a perceptible quantity<br>
        every century to the detriment of our globe, for its heat is its life."<br>
        <br>
        "But the sun?"<br>
        <br>
        "The sun is not sufficient, Conseil.  Can it give heat to a dead body?"<br>
        <br>
        "Not that I know of."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, my friend, this earth will one day be that cold corpse; it will<br>
        become uninhabitable and uninhabited like the moon, which has long<br>
        since lost all its vital heat."<br>
        <br>
        "In how many centuries?"<br>
        <br>
        "In some hundreds of thousands of years, my boy."<br>
        <br>
        "Then," said Conseil, "we shall have time to finish our journey--that<br>
        is, if Ned Land does not interfere with it."<br>
        <br>
        And Conseil, reassured, returned to the study of the bank, which the<br>
        Nautilus was skirting at a moderate speed.<br>
        <br>
        During the night of the 16th and 17th February we had entered the<br>
        second Mediterranean basin, the greatest depth of which was 1,450<br>
        fathoms.  The Nautilus, by the action of its crew, slid down the<br>
        inclined planes and buried itself in the lowest depths of the sea.<br>
        <br>
        On the 18th of February, about three o'clock in the morning, we were at<br>
        the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar.  There once existed two<br>
        currents: an upper one, long since recognised, which conveys the waters<br>
        of the ocean into the basin of the Mediterranean; and a lower<br>
        counter-current, which reasoning has now shown to exist.  Indeed, the<br>
        volume of water in the Mediterranean, incessantly added to by the waves<br>
        of the Atlantic and by rivers falling into it, would each year raise<br>
        the level of this sea, for its evaporation is not sufficient to restore<br>
        the equilibrium.  As it is not so, we must necessarily admit the<br>
        existence of an under-current, which empties into the basin of the<br>
        Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar the surplus waters of the<br>
        Mediterranean.  A fact indeed; and it was this counter-current by which<br>
        the Nautilus profited.  It advanced rapidly by the narrow pass.  For<br>
        one instant I caught a glimpse of the beautiful ruins of the temple of<br>
        Hercules, buried in the ground, according to Pliny, and with the low<br>
        island which supports it; and a few minutes later we were floating on<br>
        the Atlantic.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER VIII<br>
        <br>
        VIGO BAY<br>
        <br>
        The Atlantic! a vast sheet of water whose superficial area covers<br>
        twenty-five millions of square miles, the length of which is nine<br>
        thousand miles, with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundred--an<br>
        ocean whose parallel winding shores embrace an immense circumference,<br>
        watered by the largest rivers of the world, the St. Lawrence, the<br>
        Mississippi, the Amazon, the Plata, the Orinoco, the Niger, the<br>
        Senegal, the Elbe, the Loire, and the Rhine, which carry water from the<br>
        most civilised, as well as from the most savage, countries!<br>
        Magnificent field of water, incessantly ploughed by vessels of every<br>
        nation, sheltered by the flags of every nation, and which terminates in<br>
        those two terrible points so dreaded by mariners, Cape Horn and the<br>
        Cape of Tempests.<br>
        <br>
        The Nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having<br>
        accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a<br>
        distance greater than the great circle of the earth.  Where were we<br>
        going now, and what was reserved for the future?  The Nautilus, leaving<br>
        the Straits of Gibraltar, had gone far out.  It returned to the surface<br>
        of the waves, and our daily walks on the platform were restored to us.<br>
        <br>
        I mounted at once, accompanied by Ned Land and Conseil.  At a distance<br>
        of about twelve miles, Cape St. Vincent was dimly to be seen, forming<br>
        the south-western point of the Spanish peninsula.  A strong southerly<br>
        gale was blowing.  The sea was swollen and billowy; it made the<br>
        Nautilus rock violently.  It was almost impossible to keep one's foot<br>
        on the platform, which the heavy rolls of the sea beat over every<br>
        instant.  So we descended after inhaling some mouthfuls of fresh air.<br>
        <br>
        I returned to my room, Conseil to his cabin; but the Canadian, with a<br>
        preoccupied air, followed me.  Our rapid passage across the<br>
        Mediterranean had not allowed him to put his project into execution,<br>
        and he could not help showing his disappointment.  When the door of my<br>
        room was shut, he sat down and looked at me silently.<br>
        <br>
        "Friend Ned," said I, "I understand you; but you cannot reproach<br>
        yourself.  To have attempted to leave the Nautilus under the<br>
        circumstances would have been folly."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land did not answer; his compressed lips and frowning brow showed<br>
        with him the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of his mind.<br>
        <br>
        "Let us see," I continued; "we need not despair yet.  We are going up<br>
        the coast of Portugal again; France and England are not far off, where<br>
        we can easily find refuge.  Now if the Nautilus, on leaving the Straits<br>
        of Gibraltar, had gone to the south, if it had carried us towards<br>
        regions where there were no continents, I should share your uneasiness.<br>
        But we know now that Captain Nemo does not fly from civilised seas, and<br>
        in some days I think you can act with security."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land still looked at me fixedly; at length his fixed lips parted,<br>
        and he said, "It is for to-night."<br>
        <br>
        I drew myself up suddenly.  I was, I admit, little prepared for this<br>
        communication.  I wanted to answer the Canadian, but words would not<br>
        come.<br>
        <br>
        "We agreed to wait for an opportunity," continued Ned Land, "and the<br>
        opportunity has arrived.  This night we shall be but a few miles from<br>
        the Spanish coast.  It is cloudy.  The wind blows freely.  I have your<br>
        word, M. Aronnax, and I rely upon you."<br>
        <br>
        As I was silent, the Canadian approached me.<br>
        <br>
        "To-night, at nine o'clock," said he.  "I have warned Conseil.  At that<br>
        moment Captain Nemo will be shut up in his room, probably in bed.<br>
        Neither the engineers nor the ship's crew can see us.  Conseil and I<br>
        will gain the central staircase, and you, M. Aronnax, will remain in<br>
        the library, two steps from us, waiting my signal.  The oars, the mast,<br>
        and the sail are in the canoe.  I have even succeeded in getting some<br>
        provisions.  I have procured an English wrench, to unfasten the bolts<br>
        which attach it to the shell of the Nautilus.  So all is ready, till<br>
        to-night."<br>
        <br>
        "The sea is bad."<br>
        <br>
        "That I allow," replied the Canadian; "but we must risk that.  Liberty<br>
        is worth paying for; besides, the boat is strong, and a few miles with<br>
        a fair wind to carry us is no great thing.  Who knows but by to-morrow<br>
        we may be a hundred leagues away?  Let circumstances only favour us,<br>
        and by ten or eleven o'clock we shall have landed on some spot of terra<br>
        firma, alive or dead.  But adieu now till to-night."<br>
        <br>
        With these words the Canadian withdrew, leaving me almost dumb.  I had<br>
        imagined that, the chance gone, I should have time to reflect and<br>
        discuss the matter.  My obstinate companion had given me no time; and,<br>
        after all, what could I have said to him?  Ned Land was perfectly<br>
        right.  There was almost the opportunity to profit by.  Could I retract<br>
        my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the<br>
        future of my companions?  To-morrow Captain Nemo might take us far from<br>
        all land.<br>
        <br>
        At that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs<br>
        were filling, and that the Nautilus was sinking under the waves of the<br>
        Atlantic.<br>
        <br>
        A sad day I passed, between the desire of regaining my liberty of<br>
        action and of abandoning the wonderful Nautilus, and leaving my<br>
        submarine studies incomplete.<br>
        <a href=../site0/page0_9034.html>external_link2_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        What dreadful hours I passed thus!  Sometimes seeing myself and<br>
        companions safely landed, sometimes wishing, in spite of my reason,<br>
        that some unforeseen circumstance, would prevent the realisation of Ned<br>
        Land's project.<br>
        <br>
        Twice I went to the saloon.  I wished to consult the compass.  I wished<br>
        to see if the direction the Nautilus was taking was bringing us nearer<br>
        or taking us farther from the coast.  But no; the Nautilus kept in<br>
        Portuguese waters.<br>
        <br>
        I must therefore take my part and prepare for flight.  My luggage was<br>
        not heavy; my notes, nothing more.<br>
        <br>
        As to Captain Nemo, I asked myself what he would think of our escape;<br>
        what trouble, what wrong it might cause him and what he might do in<br>
        case of its discovery or failure.  Certainly I had no cause to complain<br>
        of him; on the contrary, never was hospitality freer than his.  In<br>
        leaving him I could not be taxed with ingratitude.  No oath bound us to<br>
        him.  It was on the strength of circumstances he relied, and not upon<br>
        our word, to fix us for ever.<br>
        <br>
        I had not seen the Captain since our visit to the Island of Santorin.<br>
        Would chance bring me to his presence before our departure?  I wished<br>
        it, and I feared it at the same time.  I listened if I could hear him<br>
        walking the room contiguous to mine.  No sound reached my ear.  I felt<br>
        an unbearable uneasiness.  This day of waiting seemed eternal.  Hours<br>
        struck too slowly to keep pace with my impatience.<br>
        <br>
        My dinner was served in my room as usual.  I ate but little; I was too<br>
        preoccupied.  I left the table at seven o'clock. A hundred and twenty<br>
        minutes (I counted them) still separated me from the moment in which I<br>
        was to join Ned Land.  My agitation redoubled.  My pulse beat<br>
        violently.  I could not remain quiet.  I went and came, hoping to calm<br>
        my troubled spirit by constant movement.  The idea of failure in our<br>
        bold enterprise was the least painful of my anxieties; but the thought<br>
        of seeing our project discovered before leaving the Nautilus, of being<br>
        brought before Captain Nemo, irritated, or (what was worse) saddened,<br>
        at my desertion, made my heart beat.<br>
        <br>
        I wanted to see the saloon for the last time.  I descended the stairs<br>
        and arrived in the museum, where I had passed so many useful and<br>
        agreeable hours.  I looked at all its riches, all its treasures, like a<br>
        man on the eve of an eternal exile, who was leaving never to return.<br>
        <br>
        These wonders of Nature, these masterpieces of art, amongst which for<br>
        so many days my life had been concentrated, I was going to abandon them<br>
        for ever!  I should like to have taken a last look through the windows<br>
        of the saloon into the waters of the Atlantic:  but the panels were<br>
        hermetically closed, and a cloak of steel separated me from that ocean<br>
        which I had not yet explored.<br>
        <br>
        In passing through the saloon, I came near the door let into the angle<br>
        which opened into the Captain's room.  To my great surprise, this door<br>
        was ajar.  I drew back involuntarily.  If Captain Nemo should be in his<br>
        room, he could see me.  But, hearing no sound, I drew nearer.  The room<br>
        was deserted.  I pushed open the door and took some steps forward.<br>
        Still the same monklike severity of aspect.<br>
        <br>
        Suddenly the clock struck eight.  The first beat of the hammer on the<br>
        bell awoke me from my dreams.  I trembled as if an invisible eye had<br>
        plunged into my most secret thoughts, and I hurried from the room.<br>
        <br>
        There my eye fell upon the compass.  Our course was still north.  The<br>
        log indicated moderate speed, the manometer a depth of about sixty feet.<br>
        <br>
        I returned to my room, clothed myself warmly--sea boots, an otterskin<br>
        cap, a great coat of byssus, lined with sealskin; I was ready, I was<br>
        waiting.  The vibration of the screw alone broke the deep silence which<br>
        reigned on board.  I listened attentively.  Would no loud voice<br>
        suddenly inform me that Ned Land had been surprised in his projected<br>
        flight.  A mortal dread hung over me, and I vainly tried to regain my<br>
        accustomed coolness.<br>
        <br>
        At a few minutes to nine, I put my ear to the Captain's door.  No<br>
        noise.  I left my room and returned to the saloon, which was half in<br>
        obscurity, but deserted.<br>
        <br>
        I opened the door communicating with the library.  The same<br>
        insufficient light, the same solitude.  I placed myself near the door<br>
        leading to the central staircase, and there waited for Ned Land's<br>
        signal.<br>
        <br>
        At that moment the trembling of the screw sensibly diminished, then it<br>
        stopped entirely.  The silence was now only disturbed by the beatings<br>
        of my own heart.  Suddenly a slight shock was felt; and I knew that the<br>
        Nautilus had stopped at the bottom of the ocean.  My uneasiness<br>
        increased.  The Canadian's signal did not come.  I felt inclined to<br>
        join Ned Land and beg of him to put off his attempt.  I felt that we<br>
        were not sailing under our usual conditions.<br>
        <br>
        At this moment the door of the large saloon opened, and Captain Nemo<br>
        appeared.  He saw me, and without further preamble began in an amiable<br>
        tone of voice:<br>
        <br>
        "Ah, sir!  I have been looking for you.  Do you know the history of<br>
        Spain?"<br>
        <br>
        Now, one might know the history of one's own country by heart; but in<br>
        the condition I was at the time, with troubled mind and head quite<br>
        lost, I could not have said a word of it.<br>
        <br>
        "Well," continued Captain Nemo, "you heard my question!  Do you know<br>
        the history of Spain?"<br>
        <br>
        "Very slightly," I answered.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, here are learned men having to learn," said the Captain.  "Come,<br>
        sit down, and I will tell you a curious episode in this history.  Sir,<br>
        listen well," said he; "this history will interest you on one side, for<br>
        it will answer a question which doubtless you have not been able to<br>
        solve."<br>
        <br>
        "I listen, Captain," said I, not knowing what my interlocutor was<br>
        driving at, and asking myself if this incident was bearing on our<br>
        projected flight.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir, if you have no objection, we will go back to 1702.  You cannot be<br>
        ignorant that your king, Louis XIV, thinking that the gesture of a<br>
        potentate was sufficient to bring the Pyrenees under his yoke, had<br>
        imposed the Duke of Anjou, his grandson, on the Spaniards.  This prince<br>
        reigned more or less badly under the name of Philip V, and had a strong<br>
        party against him abroad.  Indeed, the preceding year, the royal houses<br>
        of Holland, Austria, and England had concluded a treaty of alliance at<br>
        the Hague, with the intention of plucking the crown of Spain from the<br>
        head of Philip V, and placing it on that of an archduke to whom they<br>
        prematurely gave the title of Charles III.<br>
        <br>
        "Spain must resist this coalition; but she was almost entirely<br>
        unprovided with either soldiers or sailors.  However, money would not<br>
        fail them, provided that their galleons, laden with gold and silver<br>
        from America, once entered their ports.  And about the end of 1702 they<br>
        expected a rich convoy which France was escorting with a fleet of<br>
        twenty-three vessels, commanded by Admiral Chateau-Renaud, for the<br>
        ships of the coalition were already beating the Atlantic.  This convoy<br>
        was to go to Cadiz, but the Admiral, hearing that an English fleet was<br>
        cruising in those waters, resolved to make for a French port.<br>
        <br>
        "The Spanish commanders of the convoy objected to this decision.  They<br>
        wanted to be taken to a Spanish port, and, if not to Cadiz, into Vigo<br>
        Bay, situated on the northwest coast of Spain, and which was not<br>
        blocked.<br>
        <br>
        "Admiral Chateau-Renaud had the rashness to obey this injunction, and<br>
        the galleons entered Vigo Bay.<br>
        <br>
        "Unfortunately, it formed an open road which could not be defended in<br>
        any way.  They must therefore hasten to unload the galleons before the<br>
        arrival of the combined fleet; and time would not have failed them had<br>
        not a miserable question of rivalry suddenly arisen.<br>
        <br>
        "You are following the chain of events?" asked Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "Perfectly," said I, not knowing the end proposed by this historical<br>
        lesson.<br>
        <br>
        "I will continue.  This is what passed.  The merchants of Cadiz had a<br>
        privilege by which they had the right of receiving all merchandise<br>
        coming from the West Indies.  Now, to disembark these ingots at the<br>
        port of Vigo was depriving them of their rights.  They complained at<br>
        Madrid, and obtained the consent of the weak-minded Philip that the<br>
        convoy, without discharging its cargo, should remain sequestered in the<br>
        roads of Vigo until the enemy had disappeared.<br>
        <br>
        "But whilst coming to this decision, on the 22nd of October, 1702, the<br>
        English vessels arrived in Vigo Bay, when Admiral Chateau-Renaud, in<br>
        spite of inferior forces, fought bravely.  But, seeing that the<br>
        treasure must fall into the enemy's hands, he burnt and scuttled every<br>
        galleon, which went to the bottom with their immense riches."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo stopped.  I admit I could not see yet why this history<br>
        should interest me.<br>
        <br>
        "Well?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo, "we are in that Vigo Bay; and<br>
        it rests with yourself whether you will penetrate its mysteries."<br>
        <br>
        The Captain rose, telling me to follow him.  I had had time to recover.<br>
        I obeyed.  The saloon was dark, but through the transparent glass the<br>
        waves were sparkling.  I looked.<br>
        <br>
        For half a mile around the Nautilus, the waters seemed bathed in<br>
        electric light.  The sandy bottom was clean and bright.  Some of the<br>
        ship's crew in their diving-dresses were clearing away half-rotten<br>
        barrels and empty cases from the midst of the blackened wrecks.  From<br>
        these cases and from these barrels escaped ingots of gold and silver,<br>
        cascades of piastres and jewels.  The sand was heaped up with them.<br>
        Laden with their precious booty, the men returned to the Nautilus,<br>
        disposed of their burden, and went back to this inexhaustible fishery<br>
        of gold and silver.<br>
        <br>
        I understood now.  This was the scene of the battle of the 22nd of<br>
        October, 1702.  Here on this very spot the galleons laden for the<br>
        Spanish Government had sunk.  Here Captain Nemo came, according to his<br>
        wants, to pack up those millions with which he burdened the Nautilus.<br>
        It was for him and him alone America had given up her precious metals.<br>
        He was heir direct, without anyone to share, in those treasures torn<br>
        from the Incas and from the conquered of Ferdinand Cortez.<br>
        <br>
        "Did you know, sir," he asked, smiling, "that the sea contained such<br>
        riches?"<br>
        <br>
        "I knew," I answered, "that they value money held in suspension in<br>
        these waters at two millions."<br>
        <br>
        "Doubtless; but to extract this money the expense would be greater than<br>
        the profit.  Here, on the contrary, I have but to pick up what man has<br>
        lost--and not only in Vigo Bay, but in a thousand other ports where<br>
        shipwrecks have happened, and which are marked on my submarine map.<br>
        Can you understand now the source of the millions I am worth?"<br>
        <br>
        "I understand, Captain.  But allow me to tell you that in exploring<br>
        Vigo Bay you have only been beforehand with a rival society."<br>
        <br>
        "And which?"<br>
        <br>
        "A society which has received from the Spanish Government the privilege<br>
        of seeking those buried galleons.  The shareholders are led on by the<br>
        allurement of an enormous bounty, for they value these rich shipwrecks<br>
        at five hundred millions."<br>
        <br>
        "Five hundred millions they were," answered Captain Nemo, "but they are<br>
        so no longer."<br>
        <br>
        "Just so," said I; "and a warning to those shareholders would be an act<br>
        of charity.  But who knows if it would be well received?  What gamblers<br>
        usually regret above all is less the loss of their money than of their<br>
        foolish hopes.  After all, I pity them less than the thousands of<br>
        unfortunates to whom so much riches well-distributed would have been<br>
        profitable, whilst for them they will be for ever barren."<br>
        <br>
        I had no sooner expressed this regret than I felt that it must have<br>
        wounded Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "Barren!" he exclaimed, with animation.  "Do you think then, sir, that<br>
        these riches are lost because I gather them?  Is it for myself alone,<br>
        according to your idea, that I take the trouble to collect these<br>
        treasures?  Who told you that I did not make a good use of it?  Do you<br>
        think I am ignorant that there are suffering beings and oppressed races<br>
        on this earth, miserable creatures to console, victims to avenge?  Do<br>
        you not understand?"<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo stopped at these last words, regretting perhaps that he<br>
        had spoken so much.  But I had guessed that, whatever the motive which<br>
        had forced him to seek independence under the sea, it had left him<br>
        still a man, that his heart still beat for the sufferings of humanity,<br>
        and that his immense charity was for oppressed races as well as<br>
        individuals.  And I then understood for whom those millions were<br>
        destined which were forwarded by Captain Nemo when the Nautilus was<br>
        cruising in the waters of Crete.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER IX<br>
        <br>
        A VANISHED CONTINENT<br>
        <br>
        The next morning, the 19th of February, I saw the Canadian enter my<br>
        room.  I expected this visit.  He looked very disappointed.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, sir?" said he.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Ned, fortune was against us yesterday."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes; that Captain must needs stop exactly at the hour we intended<br>
        leaving his vessel."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Ned, he had business at his bankers."<br>
        <br>
        "His bankers!"<br>
        <br>
        "Or rather his banking-house; by that I mean the ocean, where his<br>
        riches are safer than in the chests of the State."<br>
        <br>
        I then related to the Canadian the incidents of the preceding night,<br>
        hoping to bring him back to the idea of not abandoning the Captain; but<br>
        my recital had no other result than an energetically expressed regret<br>
        from Ned that he had not been able to take a walk on the battlefield of<br>
        Vigo on his own account.<br>
        <br>
        "However," said he, "all is not ended.  It is only a blow of the<br>
        harpoon lost.  Another time we must succeed; and to-night, if<br>
        necessary----"<br>
        <br>
        "In what direction is the Nautilus going?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "I do not know," replied Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, at noon we shall see the point."<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian returned to Conseil.  As soon as I was dressed, I went<br>
        into the saloon.  The compass was not reassuring.  The course of the<br>
        Nautilus was S.S.W. We were turning our backs on Europe.<br>
        <br>
        I waited with some impatience till the ship's place was pricked on the<br>
        chart.  At about half-past eleven the reservoirs were emptied, and our<br>
        vessel rose to the surface of the ocean.  I rushed towards the<br>
        platform.  Ned Land had preceded me.  No more land in sight.  Nothing<br>
        but an immense sea.  Some sails on the horizon, doubtless those going<br>
        to San Roque in search of favourable winds for doubling the Cape of<br>
        Good Hope.  The weather was cloudy.  A gale of wind was preparing.  Ned<br>
        raved, and tried to pierce the cloudy horizon.  He still hoped that<br>
        behind all that fog stretched the land he so longed for.<br>
        <br>
        At noon the sun showed itself for an instant.  The second profited by<br>
        this brightness to take its height.  Then, the sea becoming more<br>
        billowy, we descended, and the panel closed.<br>
        <br>
        An hour after, upon consulting the chart, I saw the position of the<br>
        Nautilus was marked at 16Â° 17' long., and 33Â° 22' lat., at 150<br>
        leagues from the nearest coast.  There was no means of flight, and I<br>
        leave you to imagine the rage of the Canadian when I informed him of<br>
        our situation.<br>
        <br>
        For myself, I was not particularly sorry.  I felt lightened of the load<br>
        which had oppressed me, and was able to return with some degree of<br>
        calmness to my accustomed work.<br>
        <br>
        That night, about eleven o'clock, I received a most unexpected visit<br>
        from Captain Nemo.  He asked me very graciously if I felt fatigued from<br>
        my watch of the preceding night.  I answered in the negative.<br>
        <br>
        "Then, M. Aronnax, I propose a curious excursion."<br>
        <br>
        "Propose, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "You have hitherto only visited the submarine depths by daylight, under<br>
        the brightness of the sun.  Would it suit you to see them in the<br>
        darkness of the night?"<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site0/page0_9064.html>external_link3_text</a><br><br>
        "Most willingly."<br>
        <br>
        "I warn you, the way will be tiring.  We shall have far to walk, and<br>
        must climb a mountain.  The roads are not well kept."<br>
        <br>
        "What you say, Captain, only heightens my curiosity; I am ready to<br>
        follow you."<br>
        <br>
        "Come then, sir, we will put on our diving-dresses."<br>
        <br>
        Arrived at the robing-room, I saw that neither of my companions nor any<br>
        of the ship's crew were to follow us on this excursion.  Captain Nemo<br>
        had not even proposed my taking with me either Ned or Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        In a few moments we had put on our diving-dresses; they placed on our<br>
        backs the reservoirs, abundantly filled with air, but no electric lamps<br>
        were prepared.  I called the Captain's attention to the fact.<br>
        <br>
        "They will be useless," he replied.<br>
        <br>
        I thought I had not heard aright, but I could not repeat my<br>
        observation, for the Captain's head had already disappeared in its<br>
        metal case.  I finished harnessing myself.  I felt them put an<br>
        iron-pointed stick into my hand, and some minutes later, after going<br>
        through the usual form, we set foot on the bottom of the Atlantic at a<br>
        depth of 150 fathoms.  Midnight was near.  The waters were profoundly<br>
        dark, but Captain Nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot, a<br>
        sort of large light shining brilliantly about two miles from the<br>
        Nautilus.  What this fire might be, what could feed it, why and how it<br>
        lit up the liquid mass, I could not say.  In any case, it did light our<br>
        way, vaguely, it is true, but I soon accustomed myself to the peculiar<br>
        darkness, and I understood, under such circumstances, the uselessness<br>
        of the Ruhmkorff apparatus.<br>
        <br>
        As we advanced, I heard a kind of pattering above my head.  The noise<br>
        redoubling, sometimes producing a continual shower, I soon understood<br>
        the cause.  It was rain falling violently, and crisping the surface of<br>
        the waves.  Instinctively the thought flashed across my mind that I<br>
        should be wet through!  By the water! in the midst of the water!  I<br>
        could not help laughing at the odd idea.  But, indeed, in the thick<br>
        diving-dress, the liquid element is no longer felt, and one only seems<br>
        to be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere.<br>
        Nothing more.<br>
        <br>
        After half an hour's walk the soil became stony.  Medusae, microscopic<br>
        crustacea, and pennatules lit it slightly with their phosphorescent<br>
        gleam.  I caught a glimpse of pieces of stone covered with millions of<br>
        zoophytes and masses of sea weed.  My feet often slipped upon this<br>
        sticky carpet of sea weed, and without my iron-tipped stick I should<br>
        have fallen more than once.  In turning round, I could still see the<br>
        whitish lantern of the Nautilus beginning to pale in the distance.<br>
        <br>
        But the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon.<br>
        The presence of this fire under water puzzled me in the highest degree.<br>
        Was I going towards a natural phenomenon as yet unknown to the _savants_<br>
        of the earth?  Or even (for this thought crossed my brain) had the hand<br>
        of man aught to do with this conflagration?  Had he fanned this flame?<br>
        Was I to meet in these depths companions and friends of Captain Nemo<br>
        whom he was going to visit, and who, like him, led this strange<br>
        existence?  Should I find down there a whole colony of exiles who,<br>
        weary of the miseries of this earth, had sought and found independence<br>
        in the deep ocean?  All these foolish and unreasonable ideas pursued<br>
        me.  And in this condition of mind, over-excited by the succession of<br>
        wonders continually passing before my eyes, I should not have been<br>
        surprised to meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns<br>
        of which Captain Nemo dreamed.<br>
        <br>
        Our road grew lighter and lighter.  The white glimmer came in rays from<br>
        the summit of a mountain about 800 feet high.  But what I saw was<br>
        simply a reflection, developed by the clearness of the waters.  The<br>
        source of this inexplicable light was a fire on the opposite side of<br>
        the mountain.<br>
        <br>
        In the midst of this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the Atlantic,<br>
        Captain Nemo advanced without hesitation.  He knew this dreary road.<br>
        Doubtless he had often travelled over it, and could not lose himself.<br>
        I followed him with unshaken confidence.  He seemed to me like a genie<br>
        of the sea; and, as he walked before me, I could not help admiring his<br>
        stature, which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon.<br>
        <br>
        It was one in the morning when we arrived at the first slopes of the<br>
        mountain; but to gain access to them we must venture through the<br>
        difficult paths of a vast copse.<br>
        <br>
        Yes; a copse of dead trees, without leaves, without sap, trees<br>
        petrified by the action of the water and here and there overtopped by<br>
        gigantic pines.  It was like a coal-pit still standing, holding by the<br>
        roots to the broken soil, and whose branches, like fine black paper<br>
        cuttings, showed distinctly on the watery ceiling.  Picture to yourself<br>
        a forest in the Hartz hanging on to the sides of the mountain, but a<br>
        forest swallowed up.  The paths were encumbered with seaweed and fucus,<br>
        between which grovelled a whole world of crustacea.  I went along,<br>
        climbing the rocks, striding over extended trunks, breaking the sea<br>
        bind-weed which hung from one tree to the other; and frightening the<br>
        fishes, which flew from branch to branch.  Pressing onward, I felt no<br>
        fatigue.  I followed my guide, who was never tired.  What a spectacle!<br>
        How can I express it? how paint the aspect of those woods and rocks in<br>
        this medium--their under parts dark and wild, the upper coloured with<br>
        red tints, by that light which the reflecting powers of the waters<br>
        doubled?  We climbed rocks which fell directly after with gigantic<br>
        bounds and the low growling of an avalanche.  To right and left ran<br>
        long, dark galleries, where sight was lost.  Here opened vast glades<br>
        which the hand of man seemed to have worked; and I sometimes asked<br>
        myself if some inhabitant of these submarine regions would not suddenly<br>
        appear to me.<br>
        <br>
        But Captain Nemo was still mounting.  I could not stay behind.  I<br>
        followed boldly.  My stick gave me good help.  A false step would have<br>
        been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the<br>
        gulfs; but I walked with firm step, without feeling any giddiness.  Now<br>
        I jumped a crevice, the depth of which would have made me hesitate had<br>
        it been among the glaciers on the land; now I ventured on the unsteady<br>
        trunk of a tree thrown across from one abyss to the other, without<br>
        looking under my feet, having only eyes to admire the wild sites of<br>
        this region.<br>
        <br>
        There, monumental rocks, leaning on their regularly-cut bases, seemed<br>
        to defy all laws of equilibrium.  From between their stony knees trees<br>
        sprang, like a jet under heavy pressure, and upheld others which upheld<br>
        them.  Natural towers, large scarps, cut perpendicularly, like a<br>
        "curtain," inclined at an angle which the laws of gravitation could<br>
        never have tolerated in terrestrial regions.<br>
        <br>
        Two hours after quitting the Nautilus we had crossed the line of trees,<br>
        and a hundred feet above our heads rose the top of the mountain, which<br>
        cast a shadow on the brilliant irradiation of the opposite slope.  Some<br>
        petrified shrubs ran fantastically here and there.  Fishes got up under<br>
        our feet like birds in the long grass.  The massive rocks were rent<br>
        with impenetrable fractures, deep grottos, and unfathomable holes, at<br>
        the bottom of which formidable creatures might be heard moving.  My<br>
        blood curdled when I saw enormous antennae blocking my road, or some<br>
        frightful claw closing with a noise in the shadow of some cavity.<br>
        Millions of luminous spots shone brightly in the midst of the darkness.<br>
        They were the eyes of giant crustacea crouched in their holes; giant<br>
        lobsters setting themselves up like halberdiers, and moving their claws<br>
        with the clicking sound of pincers; titanic crabs, pointed like a gun<br>
        on its carriage; and frightful-looking poulps, interweaving their<br>
        tentacles like a living nest of serpents.<br>
        <br>
        We had now arrived on the first platform, where other surprises awaited<br>
        me.  Before us lay some picturesque ruins, which betrayed the hand of<br>
        man and not that of the Creator.  There were vast heaps of stone,<br>
        amongst which might be traced the vague and shadowy forms of castles<br>
        and temples, clothed with a world of blossoming zoophytes, and over<br>
        which, instead of ivy, sea-weed and fucus threw a thick vegetable<br>
        mantle.  But what was this portion of the globe which had been<br>
        swallowed by cataclysms?  Who had placed those rocks and stones like<br>
        cromlechs of prehistoric times?  Where was I?  Whither had Captain<br>
        Nemo's fancy hurried me?<br>
        <br>
        I would fain have asked him; not being able to, I stopped him--I seized<br>
        his arm.  But, shaking his head, and pointing to the highest point of<br>
        the mountain, he seemed to say:<br>
        <br>
        "Come, come along; come higher!"<br>
        <br>
        I followed, and in a few minutes I had climbed to the top, which for a<br>
        circle of ten yards commanded the whole mass of rock.<br>
        <br>
        I looked down the side we had just climbed.  The mountain did not rise<br>
        more than seven or eight hundred feet above the level of the plain; but<br>
        on the opposite side it commanded from twice that height the depths of<br>
        this part of the Atlantic.  My eyes ranged far over a large space lit<br>
        by a violent fulguration.  In fact, the mountain was a volcano.<br>
        <br>
        At fifty feet above the peak, in the midst of a rain of stones and<br>
        scoriae, a large crater was vomiting forth torrents of lava which fell<br>
        in a cascade of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass.  Thus situated,<br>
        this volcano lit the lower plain like an immense torch, even to the<br>
        extreme limits of the horizon.  I said that the submarine crater threw<br>
        up lava, but no flames.  Flames require the oxygen of the air to feed<br>
        upon and cannot be developed under water; but streams of lava, having<br>
        in themselves the principles of their incandescence, can attain a white<br>
        heat, fight vigorously against the liquid element, and turn it to<br>
        vapour by contact.<br>
        <br>
        Rapid currents bearing all these gases in diffusion and torrents of<br>
        lava slid to the bottom of the mountain like an eruption of Vesuvius on<br>
        another Terra del Greco.<br>
        <br>
        There indeed under my eyes, ruined, destroyed, lay a town--its roofs<br>
        open to the sky, its temples fallen, its arches dislocated, its columns<br>
        lying on the ground, from which one would still recognise the massive<br>
        character of Tuscan architecture.  Further on, some remains of a<br>
        gigantic aqueduct; here the high base of an Acropolis, with the<br>
        floating outline of a Parthenon; there traces of a quay, as if an<br>
        ancient port had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean, and<br>
        disappeared with its merchant vessels and its war-galleys. Farther on<br>
        again, long lines of sunken walls and broad, deserted streets--a<br>
        perfect Pompeii escaped beneath the waters.  Such was the sight that<br>
        Captain Nemo brought before my eyes!<br>
        <br>
        Where was I?  Where was I?  I must know at any cost.  I tried to speak,<br>
        but Captain Nemo stopped me by a gesture, and, picking up a piece of<br>
        chalk-stone, advanced to a rock of black basalt, and traced the one<br>
        word:<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ATLANTIS<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        What a light shot through my mind!  Atlantis! the Atlantis of Plato,<br>
        that continent denied by Origen and Humbolt, who placed its<br>
        disappearance amongst the legendary tales.  I had it there now before<br>
        my eyes, bearing upon it the unexceptionable testimony of its<br>
        catastrophe.  The region thus engulfed was beyond Europe, Asia, and<br>
        Lybia, beyond the columns of Hercules, where those powerful people, the<br>
        Atlantides, lived, against whom the first wars of ancient Greeks were<br>
        waged.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, led by the strangest destiny, I was treading under foot the<br>
        mountains of this continent, touching with my hand those ruins a<br>
        thousand generations old and contemporary with the geological epochs.<br>
        I was walking on the very spot where the contemporaries of the first<br>
        man had walked.<br>
        <br>
        Whilst I was trying to fix in my mind every detail of this grand<br>
        landscape, Captain Nemo remained motionless, as if petrified in mute<br>
        ecstasy, leaning on a mossy stone.  Was he dreaming of those<br>
        generations long since disappeared?  Was he asking them the secret of<br>
        human destiny?  Was it here this strange man came to steep himself in<br>
        historical recollections, and live again this ancient life--he who<br>
        wanted no modern one?  What would I not have given to know his<br>
        thoughts, to share them, to understand them!  We remained for an hour<br>
        at this place, contemplating the vast plains under the brightness of<br>
        the lava, which was some times wonderfully intense.  Rapid tremblings<br>
        ran along the mountain caused by internal bubblings, deep noise,<br>
        distinctly transmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with<br>
        majestic grandeur.  At this moment the moon appeared through the mass<br>
        of waters and threw her pale rays on the buried continent.  It was but<br>
        a gleam, but what an indescribable effect!  The Captain rose, cast one<br>
        last look on the immense plain, and then bade me follow him.<br>
        <br>
        We descended the mountain rapidly, and, the mineral forest once passed,<br>
        I saw the lantern of the Nautilus shining like a star.  The Captain<br>
        walked straight to it, and we got on board as the first rays of light<br>
        whitened the surface of the ocean.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER X<br>
        <br>
        THE SUBMARINE COAL-MINES<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 20th of February, I awoke very late:  the fatigues of<br>
        the previous night had prolonged my sleep until eleven o'clock. I<br>
        dressed quickly, and hastened to find the course the Nautilus was<br>
        taking.  The instruments showed it to be still toward the south, with a<br>
        speed of twenty miles an hour and a depth of fifty fathoms.<br>
        <br>
        The species of fishes here did not differ much from those already<br>
        noticed.  There were rays of giant size, five yards long, and endowed<br>
        with great muscular strength, which enabled them to shoot above the<br>
        waves; sharks of many kinds; amongst others, one fifteen feet long,<br>
        with triangular sharp teeth, and whose transparency rendered it almost<br>
        invisible in the water.<br>
        <br>
        Amongst bony fish Conseil noticed some about three yards long, armed at<br>
        the upper jaw with a piercing sword; other bright-coloured creatures,<br>
        known in the time of Aristotle by the name of the sea-dragon, which are<br>
        dangerous to capture on account of the spikes on their back.<br>
        <br>
        About four o'clock, the soil, generally composed of a thick mud mixed<br>
        with petrified wood, changed by degrees, and it became more stony, and<br>
        seemed strewn with conglomerate and pieces of basalt, with a sprinkling<br>
        of lava.  I thought that a mountainous region was succeeding the long<br>
        plains; and accordingly, after a few evolutions of the Nautilus, I saw<br>
        the southerly horizon blocked by a high wall which seemed to close all<br>
        exit.  Its summit evidently passed the level of the ocean.  It must be<br>
        a continent, or at least an island--one of the Canaries, or of the Cape<br>
        Verde Islands.  The bearings not being yet taken, perhaps designedly, I<br>
        was ignorant of our exact position.  In any case, such a wall seemed to<br>
        me to mark the limits of that Atlantis, of which we had in reality<br>
        passed over only the smallest part.<br>
        <br>
        Much longer should I have remained at the window admiring the beauties<br>
        of sea and sky, but the panels closed.  At this moment the Nautilus<br>
        arrived at the side of this high, perpendicular wall.  What it would<br>
        do, I could not guess.  I returned to my room; it no longer moved.  I<br>
        laid myself down with the full intention of waking after a few hours'<br>
        sleep; but it was eight o'clock the next day when I entered the saloon.<br>
        I looked at the manometer.  It told me that the Nautilus was floating<br>
        on the surface of the ocean.  Besides, I heard steps on the platform.<br>
        I went to the panel.  It was open; but, instead of broad daylight, as I<br>
        expected, I was surrounded by profound darkness.  Where were we?  Was I<br>
        mistaken?  Was it still night?  No; not a star was shining and night<br>
        has not that utter darkness.<br>
        <br>
        I knew not what to think, when a voice near me said:<br>
        <br>
        "Is that you, Professor?"<br>
        <br>
        "Ah!  Captain," I answered, "where are we?"<br>
        <br>
        "Underground, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "Underground!"  I exclaimed.  "And the Nautilus floating still?"<br>
        <br>
        "It always floats."<br>
        <br>
        "But I do not understand."<br>
        <br>
        "Wait a few minutes, our lantern will be lit, and, if you like light<br>
        places, you will be satisfied."<br>
        <br>
        I stood on the platform and waited.  The darkness was so complete that<br>
        I could not even see Captain Nemo; but, looking to the zenith, exactly<br>
        above my head, I seemed to catch an undecided gleam, a kind of twilight<br>
        filling a circular hole.  At this instant the lantern was lit, and its<br>
        vividness dispelled the faint light.  I closed my dazzled eyes for an<br>
        instant, and then looked again.  The Nautilus was stationary, floating<br>
        near a mountain which formed a sort of quay.  The lake, then,<br>
        supporting it was a lake imprisoned by a circle of walls, measuring two<br>
        miles in diameter and six in circumference.  Its level (the manometer<br>
        showed) could only be the same as the outside level, for there must<br>
        necessarily be a communication between the lake and the sea.  The high<br>
        partitions, leaning forward on their base, grew into a vaulted roof<br>
        bearing the shape of an immense funnel turned upside down, the height<br>
        being about five or six hundred yards.  At the summit was a circular<br>
        orifice, by which I had caught the slight gleam of light, evidently<br>
        daylight.<br>
        <br>
        "Where are we?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "In the very heart of an extinct volcano, the interior of which has<br>
        been invaded by the sea, after some great convulsion of the earth.<br>
        Whilst you were sleeping, Professor, the Nautilus penetrated to this<br>
        lagoon by a natural canal, which opens about ten yards beneath the<br>
        surface of the ocean.  This is its harbour of refuge, a sure,<br>
        commodious, and mysterious one, sheltered from all gales.  Show me, if<br>
        you can, on the coasts of any of your continents or islands, a road<br>
        <a href=../site4/page4_1005.html>internal_link4_text</a><br><br>
        which can give such perfect refuge from all storms."<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly," I replied, "you are in safety here, Captain Nemo.  Who<br>
        could reach you in the heart of a volcano?  But did I not see an<br>
        opening at its summit?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes; its crater, formerly filled with lava, vapour, and flames, and<br>
        which now gives entrance to the life-giving air we breathe."<br>
        <br>
        "But what is this volcanic mountain?"<br>
        <br>
        "It belongs to one of the numerous islands with which this sea is<br>
        strewn--to vessels a simple sandbank--to us an immense cavern.  Chance<br>
        led me to discover it, and chance served me well."<br>
        <br>
        "But of what use is this refuge, Captain?  The Nautilus wants no port."<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir; but it wants electricity to make it move, and the wherewithal<br>
        to make the electricity--sodium to feed the elements, coal from which<br>
        to get the sodium, and a coal-mine to supply the coal.  And exactly on<br>
        this spot the sea covers entire forests embedded during the geological<br>
        periods, now mineralised and transformed into coal; for me they are an<br>
        inexhaustible mine."<br>
        <br>
        "Your men follow the trade of miners here, then, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "Exactly so.  These mines extend under the waves like the mines of<br>
        Newcastle.  Here, in their diving-dresses, pick axe and shovel in hand,<br>
        my men extract the coal, which I do not even ask from the mines of the<br>
        earth.  When I burn this combustible for the manufacture of sodium, the<br>
        smoke, escaping from the crater of the mountain, gives it the<br>
        appearance of a still-active volcano."<br>
        <br>
        "And we shall see your companions at work?"<br>
        <br>
        "No; not this time at least; for I am in a hurry to continue our<br>
        submarine tour of the earth.  So I shall content myself with drawing<br>
        from the reserve of sodium I already possess.  The time for loading is<br>
        one day only, and we continue our voyage.  So, if you wish to go over<br>
        the cavern and make the round of the lagoon, you must take advantage of<br>
        to-day, M. Aronnax."<br>
        <br>
        I thanked the Captain and went to look for my companions, who had not<br>
        yet left their cabin.  I invited them to follow me without saying where<br>
        we were.  They mounted the platform.  Conseil, who was astonished at<br>
        nothing, seemed to look upon it as quite natural that he should wake<br>
        under a mountain, after having fallen asleep under the waves.  But Ned<br>
        Land thought of nothing but finding whether the cavern had any exit.<br>
        After breakfast, about ten o'clock, we went down on to the mountain.<br>
        <br>
        "Here we are, once more on land," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "I do not call this land," said the Canadian.  "And besides, we are not<br>
        on it, but beneath it."<br>
        <br>
        Between the walls of the mountains and the waters of the lake lay a<br>
        sandy shore which, at its greatest breadth, measured five hundred feet.<br>
        On this soil one might easily make the tour of the lake.  But the base<br>
        of the high partitions was stony ground, with volcanic locks and<br>
        enormous pumice-stones lying in picturesque heaps.  All these detached<br>
        masses, covered with enamel, polished by the action of the<br>
        subterraneous fires, shone resplendent by the light of our electric<br>
        lantern.  The mica dust from the shore, rising under our feet, flew<br>
        like a cloud of sparks.  The bottom now rose sensibly, and we soon<br>
        arrived at long circuitous slopes, or inclined planes, which took us<br>
        higher by degrees; but we were obliged to walk carefully among these<br>
        conglomerates, bound by no cement, the feet slipping on the glassy<br>
        crystal, felspar, and quartz.<br>
        <br>
        The volcanic nature of this enormous excavation was confirmed on all<br>
        sides, and I pointed it out to my companions.<br>
        <br>
        "Picture to yourselves," said I, "what this crater must have been when<br>
        filled with boiling lava, and when the level of the incandescent liquid<br>
        rose to the orifice of the mountain, as though melted on the top of a<br>
        hot plate."<br>
        <br>
        "I can picture it perfectly," said Conseil.  "But, sir, will you tell<br>
        me why the Great Architect has suspended operations, and how it is that<br>
        the furnace is replaced by the quiet waters of the lake?"<br>
        <br>
        "Most probably, Conseil, because some convulsion beneath the ocean<br>
        produced that very opening which has served as a passage for the<br>
        Nautilus.  Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed into the interior of<br>
        the mountain.  There must have been a terrible struggle between the two<br>
        elements, a struggle which ended in the victory of Neptune.  But many<br>
        ages have run out since then, and the submerged volcano is now a<br>
        peaceable grotto."<br>
        <br>
        "Very well," replied Ned Land; "I accept the explanation, sir; but, in<br>
        our own interests, I regret that the opening of which you speak was not<br>
        made above the level of the sea."<br>
        <br>
        "But, friend Ned," said Conseil, "if the passage had not been under the<br>
        sea, the Nautilus could not have gone through it."<br>
        <br>
        We continued ascending.  The steps became more and more perpendicular<br>
        and narrow.  Deep excavations, which we were obliged to cross, cut them<br>
        here and there; sloping masses had to be turned.  We slid upon our<br>
        knees and crawled along.  But Conseil's dexterity and the Canadian's<br>
        strength surmounted all obstacles.  At a height of about 31 feet the<br>
        nature of the ground changed without becoming more practicable.  To the<br>
        conglomerate and trachyte succeeded black basalt, the first dispread in<br>
        layers full of bubbles, the latter forming regular prisms, placed like<br>
        a colonnade supporting the spring of the immense vault, an admirable<br>
        specimen of natural architecture.  Between the blocks of basalt wound<br>
        long streams of lava, long since grown cold, encrusted with bituminous<br>
        rays; and in some places there were spread large carpets of sulphur.  A<br>
        more powerful light shone through the upper crater, shedding a vague<br>
        glimmer over these volcanic depressions for ever buried in the bosom of<br>
        this extinguished mountain.  But our upward march was soon stopped at a<br>
        height of about two hundred and fifty feet by impassable obstacles.<br>
        There was a complete vaulted arch overhanging us, and our ascent was<br>
        changed to a circular walk.  At the last change vegetable life began to<br>
        struggle with the mineral.  Some shrubs, and even some trees, grew from<br>
        the fractures of the walls.  I recognised some euphorbias, with the<br>
        caustic sugar coming from them; heliotropes, quite incapable of<br>
        justifying their name, sadly drooped their clusters of flowers, both<br>
        their colour and perfume half gone.  Here and there some chrysanthemums<br>
        grew timidly at the foot of an aloe with long, sickly-looking leaves.<br>
        But between the streams of lava, I saw some little violets still<br>
        slightly perfumed, and I admit that I smelt them with delight.  Perfume<br>
        is the soul of the flower, and sea-flowers have no soul.<br>
        <br>
        We had arrived at the foot of some sturdy dragon-trees, which had<br>
        pushed aside the rocks with their strong roots, when Ned Land exclaimed:<br>
        <br>
        "Ah! sir, a hive! a hive!"<br>
        <br>
        "A hive!"  I replied, with a gesture of incredulity.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, a hive," repeated the Canadian, "and bees humming round it."<br>
        <br>
        I approached, and was bound to believe my own eyes.  There at a hole<br>
        bored in one of the dragon-trees were some thousands of these ingenious<br>
        insects, so common in all the Canaries, and whose produce is so much<br>
        esteemed.  Naturally enough, the Canadian wished to gather the honey,<br>
        and I could not well oppose his wish.  A quantity of dry leaves, mixed<br>
        with sulphur, he lit with a spark from his flint, and he began to smoke<br>
        out the bees.  The humming ceased by degrees, and the hive eventually<br>
        yielded several pounds of the sweetest honey, with which Ned Land<br>
        filled his haversack.<br>
        <br>
        "When I have mixed this honey with the paste of the bread-fruit," said<br>
        he, "I shall be able to offer you a succulent cake."<br>
        <br>
        [Transcriber's Note: 'bread-fruit' has been substituted for<br>
        'artocarpus' in this ed.]<br>
        <br>
        "'Pon my word," said Conseil, "it will be gingerbread."<br>
        <br>
        "Never mind the gingerbread," said I; "let us continue our interesting<br>
        walk."<br>
        <br>
        At every turn of the path we were following, the lake appeared in all<br>
        its length and breadth.  The lantern lit up the whole of its peaceable<br>
        surface, which knew neither ripple nor wave.  The Nautilus remained<br>
        perfectly immovable.  On the platform, and on the mountain, the ship's<br>
        crew were working like black shadows clearly carved against the<br>
        luminous atmosphere.  We were now going round the highest crest of the<br>
        first layers of rock which upheld the roof.  I then saw that bees were<br>
        not the only representatives of the animal kingdom in the interior of<br>
        this volcano.  Birds of prey hovered here and there in the shadows, or<br>
        fled from their nests on the top of the rocks.  There were sparrow<br>
        hawks, with white breasts, and kestrels, and down the slopes scampered,<br>
        with their long legs, several fine fat bustards.  I leave anyone to<br>
        imagine the covetousness of the Canadian at the sight of this savoury<br>
        game, and whether he did not regret having no gun.  But he did his best<br>
        to replace the lead by stones, and, after several fruitless attempts,<br>
        he succeeded in wounding a magnificent bird.  To say that he risked his<br>
        life twenty times before reaching it is but the truth; but he managed<br>
        so well that the creature joined the honey-cakes in his bag.  We were<br>
        now obliged to descend toward the shore, the crest becoming<br>
        impracticable.  Above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a<br>
        well.  From this place the sky could be clearly seen, and clouds,<br>
        dissipated by the west wind, leaving behind them, even on the summit of<br>
        the mountain, their misty remnants--certain proof that they were only<br>
        moderately high, for the volcano did not rise more than eight hundred<br>
        feet above the level of the ocean.  Half an hour after the Canadian's<br>
        last exploit we had regained the inner shore.  Here the flora was<br>
        represented by large carpets of marine crystal, a little umbelliferous<br>
        plant very good to pickle, which also bears the name of pierce-stone<br>
        and sea-fennel. Conseil gathered some bundles of it.  As to the fauna,<br>
        it might be counted by thousands of crustacea of all sorts, lobsters,<br>
        crabs, spider-crabs, chameleon shrimps, and a large number of shells,<br>
        rockfish, and limpets.  Three-quarters of an hour later we had finished<br>
        our circuitous walk and were on board.  The crew had just finished<br>
        loading the sodium, and the Nautilus could have left that instant.  But<br>
        Captain Nemo gave no order.  Did he wish to wait until night, and leave<br>
        the submarine passage secretly?  Perhaps so.  Whatever it might be, the<br>
        next day, the Nautilus, having left its port, steered clear of all land<br>
        at a few yards beneath the waves of the Atlantic.<br>
        <br>

        CHAPTER XI<br>
        <br>
        THE SARGASSO SEA<br>
        <br>
        That day the Nautilus crossed a singular part of the Atlantic Ocean.<br>
        No one can be ignorant of the existence of a current of warm water<br>
        known by the name of the Gulf Stream.  After leaving the Gulf of<br>
        Florida, we went in the direction of Spitzbergen.  But before entering<br>
        the Gulf of Mexico, about 45Â° of N. lat., this current divides into<br>
        two arms, the principal one going towards the coast of Ireland and<br>
        Norway, whilst the second bends to the south about the height of the<br>
        Azores; then, touching the African shore, and describing a lengthened<br>
        oval, returns to the Antilles.  This second arm--it is rather a collar<br>
        than an arm--surrounds with its circles of warm water that portion of<br>
        the cold, quiet, immovable ocean called the Sargasso Sea, a perfect<br>
        lake in the open Atlantic: it takes no less than three years for the<br>
        great current to pass round it.  Such was the region the Nautilus was<br>
        now visiting, a perfect meadow, a close carpet of seaweed, fucus, and<br>
        tropical berries, so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel<br>
        could hardly tear its way through it.  And Captain Nemo, not wishing to<br>
        entangle his screw in this herbaceous mass, kept some yards beneath the<br>
        surface of the waves.  The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word<br>
        "sargazzo" which signifies kelp.  This kelp, or berry-plant, is the<br>
        principal formation of this immense bank.  And this is the reason why<br>
        these plants unite in the peaceful basin of the Atlantic.  The only<br>
        explanation which can be given, he says, seems to me to result from the<br>
        experience known to all the world.  Place in a vase some fragments of<br>
        cork or other floating body, and give to the water in the vase a<br>
        circular movement, the scattered fragments will unite in a group in the<br>
        centre of the liquid surface, that is to say, in the part least<br>
        agitated.  In the phenomenon we are considering, the Atlantic is the<br>
        vase, the Gulf Stream the circular current, and the Sargasso Sea the<br>
        central point at which the floating bodies unite.<br>
        <br>
        I share Maury's opinion, and I was able to study the phenomenon in the<br>
        very midst, where vessels rarely penetrate.  Above us floated products<br>
        of all kinds, heaped up among these brownish plants; trunks of trees<br>
        torn from the Andes or the Rocky Mountains, and floated by the Amazon<br>
        or the Mississippi; numerous wrecks, remains of keels, or ships'<br>
        bottoms, side-planks stove in, and so weighted with shells and<br>
        barnacles that they could not again rise to the surface.  And time will<br>
        one day justify Maury's other opinion, that these substances thus<br>
        accumulated for ages will become petrified by the action of the water<br>
        and will then form inexhaustible coal-mines--a precious reserve<br>
        prepared by far-seeing Nature for the moment when men shall have<br>
        exhausted the mines of continents.<br>
        <br>
        In the midst of this inextricable mass of plants and sea weed, I<br>
        noticed some charming pink halcyons and actiniae, with their long<br>
        tentacles trailing after them, and medusae, green, red, and blue.<br>
        <br>
        All the day of the 22nd of February we passed in the Sargasso Sea,<br>
        where such fish as are partial to marine plants find abundant<br>
        nourishment.  The next, the ocean had returned to its accustomed<br>
        aspect.  From this time for nineteen days, from the 23rd of February to<br>
        the 12th of March, the Nautilus kept in the middle of the Atlantic,<br>
        carrying us at a constant speed of a hundred leagues in twenty-four<br>
        hours.  Captain Nemo evidently intended accomplishing his submarine<br>
        programme, and I imagined that he intended, after doubling Cape Horn,<br>
        to return to the Australian seas of the Pacific.  Ned Land had cause<br>
        for fear.  In these large seas, void of islands, we could not attempt<br>
        to leave the boat.  Nor had we any means of opposing Captain Nemo's<br>
        will.  Our only course was to submit; but what we could neither gain by<br>
        force nor cunning, I liked to think might be obtained by persuasion.<br>
        This voyage ended, would he not consent to restore our liberty, under<br>
        an oath never to reveal his existence?--an oath of honour which we<br>
        should have religiously kept.  But we must consider that delicate<br>
        question with the Captain.  But was I free to claim this liberty?  Had<br>
        he not himself said from the beginning, in the firmest manner, that the<br>
        secret of his life exacted from him our lasting imprisonment on board<br>
        the Nautilus?  And would not my four months' silence appear to him a<br>
        tacit acceptance of our situation?  And would not a return to the<br>
        subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our<br>
        projects, if at some future time a favourable opportunity offered to<br>
        return to them?<br>
        <br>
        During the nineteen days mentioned above, no incident of any kind<br>
        happened to signalise our voyage.  I saw little of the Captain; he was<br>
        at work.  In the library I often found his books left open, especially<br>
        those on natural history.  My work on submarine depths, conned over by<br>
        him, was covered with marginal notes, often contradicting my theories<br>
        and systems; but the Captain contented himself with thus purging my<br>
        work; it was very rare for him to discuss it with me.  Sometimes I<br>
        heard the melancholy tones of his organ; but only at night, in the<br>
        midst of the deepest obscurity, when the Nautilus slept upon the<br>
        deserted ocean.  During this part of our voyage we sailed whole days on<br>
        the surface of the waves.  The sea seemed abandoned.  A few<br>
        sailing-vessels, on the road to India, were making for the Cape of Good<br>
        Hope.  One day we were followed by the boats of a whaler, who, no<br>
        doubt, took us for some enormous whale of great price; but Captain Nemo<br>
        did not wish the worthy fellows to lose their time and trouble, so<br>
        ended the chase by plunging under the water.  Our navigation continued<br>
        until the 13th of March; that day the Nautilus was employed in taking<br>
        soundings, which greatly interested me.  We had then made about 13,000<br>
        leagues since our departure from the high seas of the Pacific.  The<br>
        bearings gave us 45Â° 37' S. lat., and 37Â° 53' W. long.  It was<br>
        the same water in which Captain Denham of the Herald sounded 7,000<br>
        fathoms without finding the bottom.  There, too, Lieutenant Parker, of<br>
        the American frigate Congress, could not touch the bottom with 15,140<br>
        fathoms.  Captain Nemo intended seeking the bottom of the ocean by a<br>
        diagonal sufficiently lengthened by means of lateral planes placed at<br>
        an angle of 45Â° with the water-line of the Nautilus.  Then the<br>
        screw set to work at its maximum speed, its four blades beating the<br>
        waves with in describable force.  Under this powerful pressure, the<br>
        hull of the Nautilus quivered like a sonorous chord and sank regularly<br>
        under the water.<br>
        <br>
        At 7,000 fathoms I saw some blackish tops rising from the midst of the<br>
        waters; but these summits might belong to high mountains like the<br>
        Himalayas or Mont Blanc, even higher; and the depth of the abyss<br>
        remained incalculable.  The Nautilus descended still lower, in spite of<br>
        the great pressure.  I felt the steel plates tremble at the fastenings<br>
        of the bolts; its bars bent, its partitions groaned; the windows of the<br>
        saloon seemed to curve under the pressure of the waters.  And this firm<br>
        structure would doubtless have yielded, if, as its Captain had said, it<br>
        had not been capable of resistance like a solid block.  We had attained<br>
        a depth of 16,000 yards (four leagues), and the sides of the Nautilus<br>
        then bore a pressure of 1,600 atmospheres, that is to say, 3,200 lb.<br>
        to each square two-fifths of an inch of its surface.<br>
        <br>
        "What a situation to be in!"  I exclaimed.  "To overrun these deep<br>
        regions where man has never trod!  Look, Captain, look at these<br>
        magnificent rocks, these uninhabited grottoes, these lowest receptacles<br>
        of the globe, where life is no longer possible!  What unknown sights<br>
        are here!  Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?"<br>
        <br>
        "Would you like to carry away more than the remembrance?" said Captain<br>
        Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "What do you mean by those words?"<br>
        <br>
        "I mean to say that nothing is easier than to make a photographic view<br>
        of this submarine region."<br>
        <br>
        I had not time to express my surprise at this new proposition, when, at<br>
        Captain Nemo's call, an objective was brought into the saloon.  Through<br>
