        On the 16th of January, the Nautilus seemed becalmed only a few yards<br>
        beneath the surface of the waves.  Her electric apparatus remained<br>
        inactive and her motionless screw left her to drift at the mercy of the<br>
        currents.  I supposed that the crew was occupied with interior repairs,<br>
        rendered necessary by the violence of the mechanical movements of the<br>
        machine.<br>
        <br>
        My companions and I then witnessed a curious spectacle.  The hatches of<br>
        the saloon were open, and, as the beacon light of the Nautilus was not<br>
        in action, a dim obscurity reigned in the midst of the waters.  I<br>
        observed the state of the sea, under these conditions, and the largest<br>
        fish appeared to me no more than scarcely defined shadows, when the<br>
        Nautilus found herself suddenly transported into full light.  I thought<br>
        at first that the beacon had been lighted, and was casting its electric<br>
        radiance into the liquid mass.  I was mistaken, and after a rapid<br>
        survey perceived my error.<br>
        <br>
        The Nautilus floated in the midst of a phosphorescent bed which, in<br>
        this obscurity, became quite dazzling.  It was produced by myriads of<br>
        luminous animalculae, whose brilliancy was increased as they glided<br>
        over the metallic hull of the vessel.  I was surprised by lightning in<br>
        the midst of these luminous sheets, as though they had been rivulets of<br>
        lead melted in an ardent furnace or metallic masses brought to a white<br>
        heat, so that, by force of contrast, certain portions of light appeared<br>
        to cast a shade in the midst of the general ignition, from which all<br>
        shade seemed banished.  No; this was not the calm irradiation of our<br>
        ordinary lightning.  There was unusual life and vigour: this was truly<br>
        living light!<br>
        <br>
        In reality, it was an infinite agglomeration of coloured infusoria, of<br>
        veritable globules of jelly, provided with a threadlike tentacle, and<br>
        of which as many as twenty-five thousand have been counted in less than<br>
        two cubic half-inches of water.<br>
        <br>
        During several hours the Nautilus floated in these brilliant waves, and<br>
        our admiration increased as we watched the marine monsters disporting<br>
        themselves like salamanders.  I saw there in the midst of this fire<br>
        that burns not the swift and elegant porpoise (the indefatigable clown<br>
        of the ocean), and some swordfish ten feet long, those prophetic<br>
        heralds of the hurricane whose formidable sword would now and then<br>
        strike the glass of the saloon.  Then appeared the smaller fish, the<br>
        balista, the leaping mackerel, wolf-thorn-tails, and a hundred others<br>
        which striped the luminous atmosphere as they swam.  This dazzling<br>
        spectacle was enchanting!  Perhaps some atmospheric condition increased<br>
        the intensity of this phenomenon.  Perhaps some storm agitated the<br>
        surface of the waves.  But at this depth of some yards, the Nautilus<br>
        was unmoved by its fury and reposed peacefully in still water.<br>
        <br>
        So we progressed, incessantly charmed by some new marvel.  The days<br>
        passed rapidly away, and I took no account of them.  Ned, according to<br>
        habit, tried to vary the diet on board.  Like snails, we were fixed to<br>
        our shells, and I declare it is easy to lead a snail's life.<br>
        <br>
        Thus this life seemed easy and natural, and we thought no longer of the<br>
        life we led on land; but something happened to recall us to the<br>
        strangeness of our situation.<br>
        <br>
        On the 18th of January, the Nautilus was in 105° long. and 15°<br>
        S. lat.  The weather was threatening, the sea rough and rolling.  There<br>
        was a strong east wind.  The barometer, which had been going down for<br>
        some days, foreboded a coming storm.  I went up on to the platform just<br>
        as the second lieutenant was taking the measure of the horary angles,<br>
        and waited, according to habit till the daily phrase was said.  But on<br>
        this day it was exchanged for another phrase not less incomprehensible.<br>
        Almost directly, I saw Captain Nemo appear with a glass, looking<br>
        towards the horizon.<br>
        <br>
        For some minutes he was immovable, without taking his eye off the point<br>
        of observation.  Then he lowered his glass and exchanged a few words<br>
        with his lieutenant.  The latter seemed to be a victim to some emotion<br>
        that he tried in vain to repress.  Captain Nemo, having more command<br>
        over himself, was cool.  He seemed, too, to be making some objections<br>
        to which the lieutenant replied by formal assurances.  At least I<br>
        concluded so by the difference of their tones and gestures.  For<br>
        myself, I had looked carefully in the direction indicated without<br>
        seeing anything.  The sky and water were lost in the clear line of the<br>
        horizon.<br>
        <br>
        However, Captain Nemo walked from one end of the platform to the other,<br>
        without looking at me, perhaps without seeing me.  His step was firm,<br>
        but less regular than usual.  He stopped sometimes, crossed his arms,<br>
        and observed the sea.  What could he be looking for on that immense<br>
        expanse?<br>
        <br>
        The Nautilus was then some hundreds of miles from the nearest coast.<br>
        <br>
        The lieutenant had taken up the glass and examined the horizon<br>
        steadfastly, going and coming, stamping his foot and showing more<br>
        nervous agitation than his superior officer.  Besides, this mystery<br>
        must necessarily be solved, and before long; for, upon an order from<br>
        Captain Nemo, the engine, increasing its propelling power, made the<br>
        screw turn more rapidly.<br>
        <br>
        Just then the lieutenant drew the Captain's attention again.  The<br>
        latter stopped walking and directed his glass towards the place<br>
        indicated.  He looked long.  I felt very much puzzled, and descended to<br>
        the drawing-room, and took out an excellent telescope that I generally<br>
        used.  Then, leaning on the cage of the watch-light that jutted out<br>
        from the front of the platform, set myself to look over all the line of<br>
        the sky and sea.<br>
        <br>
        But my eye was no sooner applied to the glass than it was quickly<br>
        snatched out of my hands.<br>
        <br>
        I turned round.  Captain Nemo was before me, but I did not know him.<br>
        His face was transfigured.  His eyes flashed sullenly; his teeth were<br>
        set; his stiff body, clenched fists, and head shrunk between his<br>
        shoulders, betrayed the violent agitation that pervaded his whole<br>
        frame.  He did not move.  My glass, fallen from his hands, had rolled<br>
        at his feet.<br>
        <br>
        Had I unwittingly provoked this fit of anger?  Did this<br>
        incomprehensible person imagine that I had discovered some forbidden<br>
        secret?  No; I was not the object of this hatred, for he was not<br>
        looking at me; his eye was steadily fixed upon the impenetrable point<br>
        of the horizon.  At last Captain Nemo recovered himself.  His agitation<br>
        subsided.  He addressed some words in a foreign language to his<br>
        lieutenant, then turned to me.  "M. Aronnax," he said, in rather an<br>
        imperious tone, "I require you to keep one of the conditions that bind<br>
        you to me."<br>
        <br>
        "What is it, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "You must be confined, with your companions, until I think fit to<br>
        release you."<br>
        <br>
        "You are the master," I replied, looking steadily at him.  "But may I<br>
        ask you one question?"<br>
        <br>
        "None, sir."<br>
        <br>
        There was no resisting this imperious command, it would have been<br>
        useless.  I went down to the cabin occupied by Ned Land and Conseil,<br>
        and told them the Captain's determination.  You may judge how this<br>
        communication was received by the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        But there was not time for altercation.  Four of the crew waited at the<br>
        door, and conducted us to that cell where we had passed our first night<br>
        on board the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land would have remonstrated, but the door was shut upon him.<br>
        <br>
        "Will master tell me what this means?" asked Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        I told my companions what had passed.  They were as much astonished as<br>
        I, and equally at a loss how to account for it.<br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, I was absorbed in my own reflections, and could think of<br>
        nothing but the strange fear depicted in the Captain's countenance.  I<br>
        was utterly at a loss to account for it, when my cogitations were<br>
        disturbed by these words from Ned Land:<br>
        <br>
        "Hallo! breakfast is ready."<br>
        <br>
        And indeed the table was laid.  Evidently Captain Nemo had given this<br>
        order at the same time that he had hastened the speed of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        "Will master permit me to make a recommendation?" asked Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, my boy."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, it is that master breakfasts.  It is prudent, for we do not know<br>
        what may happen."<br>
        <br>
        "You are right, Conseil."<br>
        <br>
        "Unfortunately," said Ned Land, "they have only given us the ship's<br>
        fare."<br>
        <br>
        "Friend Ned," asked Conseil, "what would you have said if the breakfast<br>
        had been entirely forgotten?"<br>
        <br>
        This argument cut short the harpooner's recriminations.<br>
        <br>
        We sat down to table.  The meal was eaten in silence.<br>
        <br>
        Just then the luminous globe that lighted the cell went out, and left<br>
        us in total darkness.  Ned Land was soon asleep, and what astonished me<br>
        was that Conseil went off into a heavy slumber.  I was thinking what<br>
        could have caused his irresistible drowsiness, when I felt my brain<br>
        becoming stupefied.  In spite of my efforts to keep my eyes open, they<br>
        would close.  A painful suspicion seized me.  Evidently soporific<br>
        substances had been mixed with the food we had just taken.<br>
        Imprisonment was not enough to conceal Captain Nemo's projects from us,<br>
        sleep was more necessary.  I then heard the panels shut.  The<br>
        undulations of the sea, which caused a slight rolling motion, ceased.<br>
        Had the Nautilus quitted the surface of the ocean?  Had it gone back to<br>
        the motionless bed of water?  I tried to resist sleep.  It was<br>
        impossible.  My breathing grew weak.  I felt a mortal cold freeze my<br>
        stiffened and half-paralysed limbs.  My eye lids, like leaden caps,<br>
        fell over my eyes.  I could not raise them; a morbid sleep, full of<br>
        hallucinations, bereft me of my being.  Then the visions disappeared,<br>
        and left me in complete insensibility.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XXIII<br>
        <br>
        THE CORAL KINGDOM<br>
        <br>
        The next day I woke with my head singularly clear.  To my great<br>
        surprise, I was in my own room.  My companions, no doubt, had been<br>
        reinstated in their cabin, without having perceived it any more than I.<br>
        Of what had passed during the night they were as ignorant as I was, and<br>
        to penetrate this mystery I only reckoned upon the chances of the<br>
        future.<br>
        <br>
        I then thought of quitting my room.  Was I free again or a prisoner?<br>
        Quite free.  I opened the door, went to the half-deck, went up the<br>
        central stairs.  The panels, shut the evening before, were open.  I<br>
        went on to the platform.<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land and Conseil waited there for me.  I questioned them; they knew<br>
        nothing.  Lost in a heavy sleep in which they had been totally<br>
        unconscious, they had been astonished at finding themselves in their<br>
        cabin.<br>
        <br>
        As for the Nautilus, it seemed quiet and mysterious as ever.  It<br>
        floated on the surface of the waves at a moderate pace.  Nothing seemed<br>
        <a href=../site0/page0_6556.html>external_link0_text</a><br><br>
        changed on board.<br>
        <br>
        The second lieutenant then came on to the platform, and gave the usual<br>
        order below.<br>
        <br>
        As for Captain Nemo, he did not appear.<br>
        <br>
        Of the people on board, I only saw the impassive steward, who served me<br>
        with his usual dumb regularity.<br>
        <br>
        About two o'clock, I was in the drawing-room, busied in arranging my<br>
        notes, when the Captain opened the door and appeared.  I bowed.  He<br>
        made a slight inclination in return, without speaking.  I resumed my<br>
        work, hoping that he would perhaps give me some explanation of the<br>
        events of the preceding night.  He made none.  I looked at him.  He<br>
        seemed fatigued; his heavy eyes had not been refreshed by sleep; his<br>
        face looked very sorrowful.  He walked to and fro, sat down and got up<br>
        again, took a chance book, put it down, consulted his instruments<br>
        without taking his habitual notes, and seemed restless and uneasy.  At<br>
        last, he came up to me, and said:<br>
        <br>
        "Are you a doctor, M. Aronnax?"<br>
        <br>
        I so little expected such a question that I stared some time at him<br>
        without answering.<br>
        <br>
        "Are you a doctor?" he repeated.  "Several of your colleagues have<br>
        studied medicine."<br>
        <br>
        "Well," said I, "I am a doctor and resident surgeon to the hospital.  I<br>
        practised several years before entering the museum."<br>
        <br>
        "Very well, sir."<br>
        <br>
        My answer had evidently satisfied the Captain.  But, not knowing what<br>
        he would say next, I waited for other questions, reserving my answers<br>
        according to circumstances.<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax, will you consent to prescribe for one of my men?" he asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Is he ill?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes."<br>
        <br>
        "I am ready to follow you."<br>
        <br>
        "Come, then."<br>
        <br>
        I own my heart beat, I do not know why.  I saw certain connection<br>
        between the illness of one of the crew and the events of the day<br>
        before; and this mystery interested me at least as much as the sick man.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo conducted me to the poop of the Nautilus, and took me into<br>
        a cabin situated near the sailors' quarters.<br>
        <br>
        There, on a bed, lay a man about forty years of age, with a resolute<br>
        expression of countenance, a true type of an Anglo-Saxon.<br>
        <br>
        I leant over him.  He was not only ill, he was wounded.  His head,<br>
        swathed in bandages covered with blood, lay on a pillow.  I undid the<br>
        bandages, and the wounded man looked at me with his large eyes and gave<br>
        no sign of pain as I did it.  It was a horrible wound.  The skull,<br>
        shattered by some deadly weapon, left the brain exposed, which was much<br>
        injured.  Clots of blood had formed in the bruised and broken mass, in<br>
        colour like the dregs of wine.<br>
        <br>
        There was both contusion and suffusion of the brain.  His breathing was<br>
        slow, and some spasmodic movements of the muscles agitated his face.  I<br>
        felt his pulse.  It was intermittent.  The extremities of the body were<br>
        growing cold already, and I saw death must inevitably ensue.  After<br>
        dressing the unfortunate man's wounds, I readjusted the bandages on his<br>
        head, and turned to Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "What caused this wound?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "What does it signify?" he replied, evasively.  "A shock has broken one<br>
        of the levers of the engine, which struck myself.  But your opinion as<br>
        to his state?"<br>
        <br>
        I hesitated before giving it.<br>
        <br>
        "You may speak," said the Captain.  "This man does not understand<br>
        French."<br>
        <br>
        I gave a last look at the wounded man.<br>
        <br>
        "He will be dead in two hours."<br>
        <br>
        "Can nothing save him?"<br>
        <br>
        "Nothing."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo's hand contracted, and some tears glistened in his eyes,<br>
        which I thought incapable of shedding any.<br>
        <br>
        For some moments I still watched the dying man, whose life ebbed<br>
        slowly.  His pallor increased under the electric light that was shed<br>
        over his death-bed. I looked at his intelligent forehead, furrowed with<br>
        premature wrinkles, produced probably by misfortune and sorrow.  I<br>
        tried to learn the secret of his life from the last words that escaped<br>
        his lips.<br>
        <br>
        "You can go now, M. Aronnax," said the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        I left him in the dying man's cabin, and returned to my room much<br>
        affected by this scene.  During the whole day, I was haunted by<br>
        uncomfortable suspicions, and at night I slept badly, and between my<br>
        broken dreams I fancied I heard distant sighs like the notes of a<br>
        funeral psalm.  Were they the prayers of the dead, murmured in that<br>
        language that I could not understand?<br>
        <br>
        The next morning I went on to the bridge.  Captain Nemo was there<br>
        before me.  As soon as he perceived me he came to me.<br>
        <br>
        "Professor, will it be convenient to you to make a submarine excursion<br>
        to-day?"<br>
        <br>
        "With my companions?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "If they like."<br>
        <br>
        "We obey your orders, Captain."<br>
        <br>
        "Will you be so good then as to put on your cork jackets?"<br>
        <br>
        It was not a question of dead or dying.  I rejoined Ned Land and<br>
        Conseil, and told them of Captain Nemo's proposition.  Conseil hastened<br>
        to accept it, and this time the Canadian seemed quite willing to follow<br>
        our example.<br>
        <br>
        It was eight o'clock in the morning.  At half-past eight we were<br>
        equipped for this new excursion, and provided with two contrivances for<br>
        light and breathing.  The double door was open; and, accompanied by<br>
        Captain Nemo, who was followed by a dozen of the crew, we set foot, at<br>
        a depth of about thirty feet, on the solid bottom on which the Nautilus<br>
        rested.<br>
        <br>
        A slight declivity ended in an uneven bottom, at fifteen fathoms depth.<br>
        This bottom differed entirely from the one I had visited on my first<br>
        excursion under the waters of the Pacific Ocean.  Here, there was no<br>
        fine sand, no submarine prairies, no sea-forest. I immediately<br>
        recognised that marvellous region in which, on that day, the Captain<br>
        did the honours to us.  It was the coral kingdom.<br>
        <br>
        The light produced a thousand charming varieties, playing in the midst<br>
        of the branches that were so vividly coloured.  I seemed to see the<br>
        membraneous and cylindrical tubes tremble beneath the undulation of the<br>
        waters.  I was tempted to gather their fresh petals, ornamented with<br>
        delicate tentacles, some just blown, the others budding, while a small<br>
        fish, swimming swiftly, touched them slightly, like flights of birds.<br>
        But if my hand approached these living flowers, these animated,<br>
        sensitive plants, the whole colony took alarm.  The white petals<br>
        re-entered their red cases, the flowers faded as I looked, and the bush<br>
        changed into a block of stony knobs.<br>
        <br>
        Chance had thrown me just by the most precious specimens of the<br>
        zoophyte.  This coral was more valuable than that found in the<br>
        Mediterranean, on the coasts of France, Italy and Barbary.  Its tints<br>
        justified the poetical names of "Flower of Blood," and "Froth of<br>
        Blood," that trade has given to its most beautiful productions.  Coral<br>
        is sold for L20 per ounce; and in this place the watery beds would make<br>
        the fortunes of a company of coral-divers. This precious matter, often<br>
        confused with other polypi, formed then the inextricable plots called<br>
        "macciota," and on which I noticed several beautiful specimens of pink<br>
        coral.<br>
        <br>
        But soon the bushes contract, and the arborisations increase. Real<br>
        petrified thickets, long joints of fantastic architecture, were<br>
        disclosed before us. Captain Nemo placed himself under a dark gallery,<br>
        where by a slight declivity we reached a depth of a hundred yards. The<br>
        light from our lamps produced sometimes magical effects, following the<br>
        rough outlines of the natural arches and pendants disposed like<br>
        lustres, that were tipped with points of fire.<br>
        <br>
        At last, after walking two hours, we had attained a depth of about<br>
        three hundred yards, that is to say, the extreme limit on which coral<br>
        begins to form.  But there was no isolated bush, nor modest brushwood,<br>
        at the bottom of lofty trees.  It was an immense forest of large<br>
        mineral vegetations, enormous petrified trees, united by garlands of<br>
        elegant sea-bindweed, all adorned with clouds and reflections.  We<br>
        passed freely under their high branches, lost in the shade of the waves.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo had stopped.  I and my companions halted, and, turning<br>
        round, I saw his men were forming a semi-circle round their chief.<br>
        Watching attentively, I observed that four of them carried on their<br>
        shoulders an object of an oblong shape.<br>
        <br>
        We occupied, in this place, the centre of a vast glade surrounded by<br>
        the lofty foliage of the submarine forest.  Our lamps threw over this<br>
        place a sort of clear twilight that singularly elongated the shadows on<br>
        the ground.  At the end of the glade the darkness increased, and was<br>
        only relieved by little sparks reflected by the points of coral.<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land and Conseil were near me.  We watched, and I thought I was<br>
        going to witness a strange scene.  On observing the ground, I saw that<br>
        it was raised in certain places by slight excrescences encrusted with<br>
        limy deposits, and disposed with a regularity that betrayed the hand of<br>
        man.<br>
        <br>
        In the midst of the glade, on a pedestal of rocks roughly piled up,<br>
        stood a cross of coral that extended its long arms that one might have<br>
        thought were made of petrified blood.  Upon a sign from Captain Nemo<br>
        one of the men advanced; and at some feet from the cross he began to<br>
        dig a hole with a pickaxe that he took from his belt.  I understood<br>
        all!  This glade was a cemetery, this hole a tomb, this oblong object<br>
        the body of the man who had died in the night!  The Captain and his men<br>
        had come to bury their companion in this general resting-place, at the<br>
        bottom of this inaccessible ocean!<br>
        <br>
        The grave was being dug slowly; the fish fled on all sides while their<br>
        retreat was being thus disturbed; I heard the strokes of the pickaxe,<br>
        which sparkled when it hit upon some flint lost at the bottom of the<br>
        waters.  The hole was soon large and deep enough to receive the body.<br>
        Then the bearers approached; the body, enveloped in a tissue of white<br>
        linen, was lowered into the damp grave.  Captain Nemo, with his arms<br>
        crossed on his breast, and all the friends of him who had loved them,<br>
        knelt in prayer.<br>
        <br>
        The grave was then filled in with the rubbish taken from the ground,<br>
        <a href=../site0/page0_1420.html>external_link1_text</a><br><br>
        which formed a slight mound.  When this was done, Captain Nemo and his<br>
        men rose; then, approaching the grave, they knelt again, and all<br>
        extended their hands in sign of a last adieu.  Then the funeral<br>
        procession returned to the Nautilus, passing under the arches of the<br>
        forest, in the midst of thickets, along the coral bushes, and still on<br>
        the ascent.  At last the light of the ship appeared, and its luminous<br>
        track guided us to the Nautilus.  At one o'clock we had returned.<br>
        <br>
        As soon as I had changed my clothes I went up on to the platform, and,<br>
        a prey to conflicting emotions, I sat down near the binnacle.  Captain<br>
        Nemo joined me.  I rose and said to him:<br>
        <br>
        "So, as I said he would, this man died in the night?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, M. Aronnax."<br>
        <br>
        "And he rests now, near his companions, in the coral cemetery?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, forgotten by all else, but not by us.  We dug the grave, and the<br>
        polypi undertake to seal our dead for eternity." And, burying his face<br>
        quickly in his hands, he tried in vain to suppress a sob.  Then he<br>
        added:  "Our peaceful cemetery is there, some hundred feet below the<br>
        surface of the waves."<br>
        <br>
        "Your dead sleep quietly, at least, Captain, out of the reach of<br>
        sharks."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir, of sharks and men," gravely replied the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        PART TWO<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER I<br>
        <br>
        THE INDIAN OCEAN<br>
        <br>
        We now come to the second part of our journey under the sea.  The first<br>
        ended with the moving scene in the coral cemetery which left such a<br>
        deep impression on my mind.  Thus, in the midst of this great sea,<br>
        Captain Nemo's life was passing, even to his grave, which he had<br>
        prepared in one of its deepest abysses.  There, not one of the ocean's<br>
        monsters could trouble the last sleep of the crew of the Nautilus, of<br>
        those friends riveted to each other in death as in life.  "Nor any man,<br>
        either," had added the Captain.  Still the same fierce, implacable<br>
        defiance towards human society!<br>
        <br>
        I could no longer content myself with the theory which satisfied<br>
        Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        That worthy fellow persisted in seeing in the Commander of the Nautilus<br>
        one of those unknown _savants_ who return mankind contempt for<br>
        indifference.  For him, he was a misunderstood genius who, tired of<br>
        earth's deceptions, had taken refuge in this inaccessible medium, where<br>
        he might follow his instincts freely.  To my mind, this explains but<br>
        one side of Captain Nemo's character.  Indeed, the mystery of that last<br>
        night during which we had been chained in prison, the sleep, and the<br>
        precaution so violently taken by the Captain of snatching from my eyes<br>
        the glass I had raised to sweep the horizon, the mortal wound of the<br>
        man, due to an unaccountable shock of the Nautilus, all put me on a new<br>
        track.  No; Captain Nemo was not satisfied with shunning man.  His<br>
        formidable apparatus not only suited his instinct of freedom, but<br>
        perhaps also the design of some terrible retaliation.<br>
        <br>
        At this moment nothing is clear to me; I catch but a glimpse of light<br>
        amidst all the darkness, and I must confine myself to writing as events<br>
        shall dictate.<br>
        <br>
        That day, the 24th of January, 1868, at noon, the second officer came<br>
        to take the altitude of the sun.  I mounted the platform, lit a cigar,<br>
        and watched the operation.  It seemed to me that the man did not<br>
        understand French; for several times I made remarks in a loud voice,<br>
        which must have drawn from him some involuntary sign of attention, if<br>
        he had understood them; but he remained undisturbed and dumb.<br>
        <br>
        As he was taking observations with the sextant, one of the sailors of<br>
        the Nautilus (the strong man who had accompanied us on our first<br>
        submarine excursion to the Island of Crespo) came to clean the glasses<br>
        of the lantern.  I examined the fittings of the apparatus, the strength<br>
        of which was increased a hundredfold by lenticular rings, placed<br>
        similar to those in a lighthouse, and which projected their brilliance<br>
        in a horizontal plane.  The electric lamp was combined in such a way as<br>
        to give its most powerful light.  Indeed, it was produced in vacuo,<br>
        which insured both its steadiness and its intensity.  This vacuum<br>
        economised the graphite points between which the luminous arc was<br>
        developed--an important point of economy for Captain Nemo, who could<br>
        not easily have replaced them; and under these conditions their waste<br>
        was imperceptible.  When the Nautilus was ready to continue its<br>
        submarine journey, I went down to the saloon.  The panel was closed,<br>
        and the course marked direct west.<br>
        <br>
        We were furrowing the waters of the Indian Ocean, a vast liquid plain,<br>
        with a surface of 1,200,000,000 of acres, and whose waters are so clear<br>
        and transparent that any one leaning over them would turn giddy.  The<br>
        Nautilus usually floated between fifty and a hundred fathoms deep.  We<br>
        went on so for some days.  To anyone but myself, who had a great love<br>
        for the sea, the hours would have seemed long and monotonous; but the<br>
        daily walks on the platform, when I steeped myself in the reviving air<br>
        of the ocean, the sight of the rich waters through the windows of the<br>
        saloon, the books in the library, the compiling of my memoirs, took up<br>
        all my time, and left me not a moment of ennui or weariness.<br>
        <br>
        For some days we saw a great number of aquatic birds, sea-mews or<br>
        gulls.  Some were cleverly killed and, prepared in a certain way, made<br>
        very acceptable water-game. Amongst large-winged birds, carried a long<br>
        distance from all lands and resting upon the waves from the fatigue of<br>
        their flight, I saw some magnificent albatrosses, uttering discordant<br>
        cries like the braying of an ass, and birds belonging to the family of<br>
        the long-wings.<br>
        <br>
        As to the fish, they always provoked our admiration when we surprised<br>
        the secrets of their aquatic life through the open panels.  I saw many<br>
        kinds which I never before had a chance of observing.<br>
        <br>
        I shall notice chiefly ostracions peculiar to the Red Sea, the Indian<br>
        Ocean, and that part which washes the coast of tropical America. These<br>
        fishes, like the tortoise, the armadillo, the sea-hedgehog, and the<br>
        Crustacea, are protected by a breastplate which is neither chalky nor<br>
        stony, but real bone. In some it takes the form of a solid triangle, in<br>
        others of a solid quadrangle. Amongst the triangular I saw some an inch<br>
        and a half in length, with wholesome flesh and a delicious flavour;<br>
        they are brown at the tail, and yellow at the fins, and I recommend<br>
        their introduction into fresh water, to which a certain number of<br>
        sea-fish easily accustom themselves. I would also mention quadrangular<br>
        ostracions, having on the back four large tubercles; some dotted over<br>
        with white spots on the lower part of the body, and which may be tamed<br>
        like birds; trigons provided with spikes formed by the lengthening of<br>
        their bony shell, and which, from their strange gruntings, are called<br>
        "seapigs"; also dromedaries with large humps in the shape of a cone,<br>
        whose flesh is very tough and leathery.<br>
        <br>
        I now borrow from the daily notes of Master Conseil. "Certain fish of<br>
        the genus petrodon peculiar to those seas, with red backs and white<br>
        chests, which are distinguished by three rows of longitudinal<br>
        filaments; and some electrical, seven inches long, decked in the<br>
        liveliest colours.  Then, as specimens of other kinds, some ovoides,<br>
        resembling an egg of a dark brown colour, marked with white bands, and<br>
        without tails; diodons, real sea-porcupines, furnished with spikes, and<br>
        capable of swelling in such a way as to look like cushions bristling<br>
        with darts; hippocampi, common to every ocean; some pegasi with<br>
        lengthened snouts, which their pectoral fins, being much elongated and<br>
        formed in the shape of wings, allow, if not to fly, at least to shoot<br>
        into the air; pigeon spatulae, with tails covered with many rings of<br>
        shell; macrognathi with long jaws, an excellent fish, nine inches long,<br>
        and bright with most agreeable colours; pale-coloured calliomores, with<br>
        rugged heads; and plenty of chaetpdons, with long and tubular muzzles,<br>
        which kill insects by shooting them, as from an air-gun, with a single<br>
        drop of water. These we may call the flycatchers of the seas.<br>
        <br>
        "In the eighty-ninth genus of fishes, classed by Lacepede, belonging to<br>
        the second lower class of bony, characterised by opercules and<br>
        bronchial membranes, I remarked the scorpaena, the head of which is<br>
        furnished with spikes, and which has but one dorsal fin; these<br>
        creatures are covered, or not, with little shells, according to the<br>
        sub-class to which they belong. The second sub-class gives us specimens<br>
        of didactyles fourteen or fifteen inches in length, with yellow rays,<br>
        and heads of a most fantastic appearance. As to the first sub-class, it<br>
        gives several specimens of that singular looking fish appropriately<br>
        called a 'seafrog,' with large head, sometimes pierced with holes,<br>
        sometimes swollen with protuberances, bristling with spikes, and<br>
        covered with tubercles; it has irregular and hideous horns; its body<br>
        and tail are covered with callosities; its sting makes a dangerous<br>
        wound; it is both repugnant and horrible to look at."<br>
        <br>
        From the 21st to the 23rd of January the Nautilus went at the rate of<br>
        two hundred and fifty leagues in twenty-four hours, being five hundred<br>
        and forty miles, or twenty-two miles an hour.  If we recognised so many<br>
        different varieties of fish, it was because, attracted by the electric<br>
        light, they tried to follow us; the greater part, however, were soon<br>
        distanced by our speed, though some kept their place in the waters of<br>
        the Nautilus for a time.  The morning of the 24th, in 12° 5' S.<br>
        lat., and 94° 33' long., we observed Keeling Island, a coral<br>
        formation, planted with magnificent cocos, and which had been visited<br>
        by Mr. Darwin and Captain Fitzroy.  The Nautilus skirted the shores of<br>
        this desert island for a little distance.  Its nets brought up numerous<br>
        specimens of polypi and curious shells of mollusca.  Some precious<br>
        productions of the species of delphinulae enriched the treasures of<br>
        Captain Nemo, to which I added an astraea punctifera, a kind of<br>
        parasite polypus often found fixed to a shell.<br>
        <br>
        Soon Keeling Island disappeared from the horizon, and our course was<br>
        directed to the north-west in the direction of the Indian Peninsula.<br>
        <br>
        From Keeling Island our course was slower and more variable, often<br>
        taking us into great depths.  Several times they made use of the<br>
        inclined planes, which certain internal levers placed obliquely to the<br>
        waterline.  In that way we went about two miles, but without ever<br>
        obtaining the greatest depths of the Indian Sea, which soundings of<br>
        seven thousand fathoms have never reached.  As to the temperature of<br>
        the lower strata, the thermometer invariably indicated 4° above<br>
        zero.  I only observed that in the upper regions the water was always<br>
        colder in the high levels than at the surface of the sea.<br>
        <br>
        On the 25th of January the ocean was entirely deserted; the Nautilus<br>
        passed the day on the surface, beating the waves with its powerful<br>
        screw and making them rebound to a great height.  Who under such<br>
        circumstances would not have taken it for a gigantic cetacean?  Three<br>
        parts of this day I spent on the platform.  I watched the sea.  Nothing<br>
        on the horizon, till about four o'clock a steamer running west on our<br>
        counter.  Her masts were visible for an instant, but she could not see<br>
        the Nautilus, being too low in the water.  I fancied this steamboat<br>
        belonged to the P.O. Company, which runs from Ceylon to Sydney,<br>
        touching at King George's Point and Melbourne.<br>
        <br>
        At five o'clock in the evening, before that fleeting twilight which<br>
        binds night to day in tropical zones, Conseil and I were astonished by<br>
        a curious spectacle.<br>
        <br>
        It was a shoal of argonauts travelling along on the surface of the<br>
        ocean.  We could count several hundreds.  They belonged to the tubercle<br>
        kind which are peculiar to the Indian seas.<br>
        <br>
        These graceful molluscs moved backwards by means of their locomotive<br>
        tube, through which they propelled the water already drawn in.  Of<br>
        their eight tentacles, six were elongated, and stretched out floating<br>
        on the water, whilst the other two, rolled up flat, were spread to the<br>
        wing like a light sail.  I saw their spiral-shaped and fluted shells,<br>
        <a href=../site0/page0_9034.html>external_link2_text</a><br><br>
        which Cuvier justly compares to an elegant skiff.  A boat indeed!  It<br>
        bears the creature which secretes it without its adhering to it.<br>
        <br>
        For nearly an hour the Nautilus floated in the midst of this shoal of<br>
        molluscs.  Then I know not what sudden fright they took.  But as if at<br>
        a signal every sail was furled, the arms folded, the body drawn in, the<br>
        shells turned over, changing their centre of gravity, and the whole<br>
        fleet disappeared under the waves.  Never did the ships of a squadron<br>
        manoeuvre with more unity.<br>
        <br>
        At that moment night fell suddenly, and the reeds, scarcely raised by<br>
        the breeze, lay peaceably under the sides of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, 26th of January, we cut the equator at the eighty-second<br>
        meridian and entered the northern hemisphere.  During the day a<br>
        formidable troop of sharks accompanied us, terrible creatures, which<br>
        multiply in these seas and make them very dangerous.  They were<br>
        "cestracio philippi" sharks, with brown backs and whitish bellies,<br>
        armed with eleven rows of teeth--eyed sharks--their throat being marked<br>
        with a large black spot surrounded with white like an eye.  There were<br>
        also some Isabella sharks, with rounded snouts marked with dark spots.<br>
        These powerful creatures often hurled themselves at the windows of the<br>
        saloon with such violence as to make us feel very insecure.  At such<br>
        times Ned Land was no longer master of himself.  He wanted to go to the<br>
        surface and harpoon the monsters, particularly certain smooth-hound<br>
        sharks, whose mouth is studded with teeth like a mosaic; and large<br>
        tiger-sharks nearly six yards long, the last named of which seemed to<br>
        excite him more particularly.  But the Nautilus, accelerating her<br>
        speed, easily left the most rapid of them behind.<br>
        <br>
        The 27th of January, at the entrance of the vast Bay of Bengal, we met<br>
        repeatedly a forbidding spectacle, dead bodies floating on the surface<br>
        of the water.  They were the dead of the Indian villages, carried by<br>
        the Ganges to the level of the sea, and which the vultures, the only<br>
        undertakers of the country, had not been able to devour.  But the<br>
        sharks did not fail to help them at their funeral work.<br>
        <br>
        About seven o'clock in the evening, the Nautilus, half-immersed, was<br>
        sailing in a sea of milk.  At first sight the ocean seemed lactified.<br>
        Was it the effect of the lunar rays?  No; for the moon, scarcely two<br>
        days old, was still lying hidden under the horizon in the rays of the<br>
        sun.  The whole sky, though lit by the sidereal rays, seemed black by<br>
        contrast with the whiteness of the waters.<br>
        <br>
        Conseil could not believe his eyes, and questioned me as to the cause<br>
        of this strange phenomenon.  Happily I was able to answer him.<br>
        <br>
        "It is called a milk sea," I explained.  "A large extent of white<br>
        wavelets often to be seen on the coasts of Amboyna, and in these parts<br>
        of the sea."<br>
        <br>
        "But, sir," said Conseil, "can you tell me what causes such an effect?<br>
        for I suppose the water is not really turned into milk."<br>
        <br>
        "No, my boy; and the whiteness which surprises you is caused only by<br>
        the presence of myriads of infusoria, a sort of luminous little worm,<br>
        gelatinous and without colour, of the thickness of a hair, and whose<br>
        length is not more than seven-thousandths of an inch.  These insects<br>
        adhere to one another sometimes for several leagues."<br>
        <br>
        "Several leagues!" exclaimed Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, my boy; and you need not try to compute the number of these<br>
        infusoria.  You will not be able, for, if I am not mistaken, ships have<br>
        floated on these milk seas for more than forty miles."<br>
        <br>
        Towards midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual colour; but behind<br>
        us, even to the limits of the horizon, the sky reflected the whitened<br>
        waves, and for a long time seemed impregnated with the vague<br>
        glimmerings of an aurora borealis.<br>
        <br>

        CHAPTER II<br>
        <br>
        A NOVEL PROPOSAL OF CAPTAIN NEMO'S<br>
        <br>
        On the 28th of February, when at noon the Nautilus came to the surface<br>
        of the sea, in 9° 4' N. lat., there was land in sight about eight<br>
        miles to westward.  The first thing I noticed was a range of mountains<br>
        about two thousand feet high, the shapes of which were most capricious.<br>
        On taking the bearings, I knew that we were nearing the island of<br>
        Ceylon, the pearl which hangs from the lobe of the Indian Peninsula.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo and his second appeared at this moment.  The Captain<br>
        glanced at the map.  Then turning to me, said:<br>
        <br>
        "The Island of Ceylon, noted for its pearl-fisheries. Would you like to<br>
        visit one of them, M. Aronnax?"<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly, Captain."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, the thing is easy.  Though, if we see the fisheries, we shall<br>
        not see the fishermen.  The annual exportation has not yet begun.<br>
        Never mind, I will give orders to make for the Gulf of Manaar, where we<br>
        shall arrive in the night."<br>
        <br>
        The Captain said something to his second, who immediately went out.<br>
        Soon the Nautilus returned to her native element, and the manometer<br>
        showed that she was about thirty feet deep.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, sir," said Captain Nemo, "you and your companions shall visit<br>
        the Bank of Manaar, and if by chance some fisherman should be there, we<br>
        shall see him at work."<br>
        <br>
        "Agreed, Captain!"<br>
        <br>
        "By the bye, M. Aronnax you are not afraid of sharks?"<br>
        <br>
        "Sharks!" exclaimed I.<br>
        <br>
        This question seemed a very hard one.<br>
        <br>
        "Well?" continued Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "I admit, Captain, that I am not yet very familiar with that kind of<br>
        fish."<br>
        <br>
        "We are accustomed to them," replied Captain Nemo, "and in time you<br>
        will be too.  However, we shall be armed, and on the road we may be<br>
        able to hunt some of the tribe.  It is interesting.  So, till<br>
        to-morrow, sir, and early."<br>
        <br>
        This said in a careless tone, Captain Nemo left the saloon.  Now, if<br>
        you were invited to hunt the bear in the mountains of Switzerland, what<br>
        would you say?<br>
        <br>
        "Very well! to-morrow we will go and hunt the bear." If you were asked<br>
        to hunt the lion in the plains of Atlas, or the tiger in the Indian<br>
        jungles, what would you say?<br>
        <br>
        "Ha! ha! it seems we are going to hunt the tiger or the lion!" But when<br>
        you are invited to hunt the shark in its natural element, you would<br>
        perhaps reflect before accepting the invitation.  As for myself, I<br>
        passed my hand over my forehead, on which stood large drops of cold<br>
        perspiration.  "Let us reflect," said I, "and take our time.  Hunting<br>
        otters in submarine forests, as we did in the Island of Crespo, will<br>
        pass; but going up and down at the bottom of the sea, where one is<br>
        almost certain to meet sharks, is quite another thing!  I know well<br>
        that in certain countries, particularly in the Andaman Islands, the<br>
        negroes never hesitate to attack them with a dagger in one hand and a<br>
        running noose in the other; but I also know that few who affront those<br>
        creatures ever return alive.  However, I am not a negro, and if I were<br>
        I think a little hesitation in this case would not be ill-timed."<br>
        <br>
        At this moment Conseil and the Canadian entered, quite composed, and<br>
        even joyous.  They knew not what awaited them.<br>
        <br>
        "Faith, sir," said Ned Land, "your Captain Nemo--the devil take<br>
        him!--has just made us a very pleasant offer."<br>
        <br>
        "Ah!" said I, "you know?"<br>
        <br>
        "If agreeable to you, sir," interrupted Conseil, "the commander of the<br>
        Nautilus has invited us to visit the magnificent Ceylon fisheries<br>
        to-morrow, in your company; he did it kindly, and behaved like a real<br>
        gentleman."<br>
        <br>
        "He said nothing more?"<br>
        <br>
        "Nothing more, sir, except that he had already spoken to you of this<br>
        little walk."<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said Conseil, "would you give us some details of the pearl<br>
        fishery?"<br>
        <br>
        "As to the fishing itself," I asked, "or the incidents, which?"<br>
        <br>
        "On the fishing," replied the Canadian; "before entering upon the<br>
        ground, it is as well to know something about it."<br>
        <br>
        "Very well; sit down, my friends, and I will teach you."<br>
        <br>
        Ned and Conseil seated themselves on an ottoman, and the first thing<br>
        the Canadian asked was:<br>
        <br>
        "Sir, what is a pearl?"<br>
        <br>
        "My worthy Ned," I answered, "to the poet, a pearl is a tear of the<br>
        sea; to the Orientals, it is a drop of dew solidified; to the ladies,<br>
        it is a jewel of an oblong shape, of a brilliancy of mother-of-pearl<br>
        substance, which they wear on their fingers, their necks, or their<br>
        ears; for the chemist it is a mixture of phosphate and carbonate of<br>
        lime, with a little gelatine; and lastly, for naturalists, it is simply<br>
        a morbid secretion of the organ that produces the mother-of-pearl<br>
        amongst certain bivalves."<br>
        <br>
        "Branch of molluscs," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Precisely so, my learned Conseil; and, amongst these testacea the<br>
        earshell, the tridacnae, the turbots, in a word, all those which<br>
        secrete mother-of-pearl, that is, the blue, bluish, violet, or white<br>
        substance which lines the interior of their shells, are capable of<br>
        producing pearls."<br>
        <br>
        "Mussels too?" asked the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, mussels of certain waters in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Saxony,<br>
        Bohemia, and France."<br>
        <br>
        "Good!  For the future I shall pay attention," replied the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "But," I continued, "the particular mollusc which secretes the pearl is<br>
        the pearl-oyster, the meleagrina margaritiferct, that precious<br>
        pintadine. The pearl is nothing but a nacreous formation, deposited in<br>
        a globular form, either adhering to the oyster shell, or buried in the<br>
        folds of the creature. On the shell it is fast; in the flesh it is<br>
        loose; but always has for a kernel a small hard substance, may be a<br>
        barren egg, may be a grain of sand, around which the pearly matter<br>
        deposits itself year after year successively, and by thin concentric<br>
        layers."<br>
        <br>
        "Are many pearls found in the same oyster?" asked Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, my boy.  Some are a perfect casket.  One oyster has been<br>
        mentioned, though I allow myself to doubt it, as having contained no<br>
        less than a hundred and fifty sharks."<br>
        <br>
        "A hundred and fifty sharks!" exclaimed Ned Land.<br>
        <a href=../site4/page4_2164.html>internal_link3_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        "Did I say sharks?" said I hurriedly.  "I meant to say a hundred and<br>
        fifty pearls.  Sharks would not be sense."<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly not," said Conseil; "but will you tell us now by what means<br>
        they extract these pearls?"<br>
        <br>
        "They proceed in various ways.  When they adhere to the shell, the<br>
        fishermen often pull them off with pincers; but the most common way is<br>
        to lay the oysters on mats of the seaweed which covers the banks.  Thus<br>
        they die in the open air; and at the end of ten days they are in a<br>
        forward state of decomposition.  They are then plunged into large<br>
        reservoirs of sea-water; then they are opened and washed."<br>
        <br>
        "The price of these pearls varies according to their size?" asked<br>
        Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Not only according to their size," I answered, "but also according to<br>
        their shape, their water (that is, their colour), and their lustre:<br>
        that is, that bright and diapered sparkle which makes them so charming<br>
        to the eye.  The most beautiful are called virgin pearls, or paragons.<br>
        They are formed alone in the tissue of the mollusc, are white, often<br>
        opaque, and sometimes have the transparency of an opal; they are<br>
        generally round or oval.  The round are made into bracelets, the oval<br>
        into pendants, and, being more precious, are sold singly.  Those<br>
        adhering to the shell of the oyster are more irregular in shape, and<br>
        are sold by weight.  Lastly, in a lower order are classed those small<br>
        pearls known under the name of seed-pearls; they are sold by measure,<br>
        and are especially used in embroidery for church ornaments."<br>
        <br>
        "But," said Conseil, "is this pearl-fishery dangerous?"<br>
        <br>
        "No," I answered, quickly; "particularly if certain precautions are<br>
        taken."<br>
        <br>
        "What does one risk in such a calling?" said Ned Land, "the swallowing<br>
        of some mouthfuls of sea-water?"<br>
        <br>
        "As you say, Ned.  By the bye," said I, trying to take Captain Nemo's<br>
        careless tone, "are you afraid of sharks, brave Ned?"<br>
        <br>
        "I!" replied the Canadian; "a harpooner by profession?  It is my trade<br>
        to make light of them."<br>
        <br>
        "But," said I, "it is not a question of fishing for them with an<br>
        iron-swivel, hoisting them into the vessel, cutting off their tails<br>
        with a blow of a chopper, ripping them up, and throwing their heart<br>
        into the sea!"<br>
        <br>
        "Then, it is a question of----"<br>
        <br>
        "Precisely."<br>
        <br>
        "In the water?"<br>
        <br>
        "In the water."<br>
        <br>
        "Faith, with a good harpoon!  You know, sir, these sharks are<br>
        ill-fashioned beasts.  They turn on their bellies to seize you, and in<br>
        that time----"<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land had a way of saying "seize" which made my blood run cold.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, and you, Conseil, what do you think of sharks?"<br>
        <br>
        "Me!" said Conseil.  "I will be frank, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "So much the better," thought I.<br>
        <br>
        "If you, sir, mean to face the sharks, I do not see why your faithful<br>
        servant should not face them with you."<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER III<br>
        <br>
        A PEARL OF TEN MILLIONS<br>
        <br>
        The next morning at four o'clock I was awakened by the steward whom<br>
        Captain Nemo had placed at my service.  I rose hurriedly, dressed, and<br>
        went into the saloon.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo was awaiting me.<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax," said he, "are you ready to start?"<br>
        <br>
        "I am ready."<br>
        <br>
        "Then please to follow me."<br>
        <br>
        "And my companions, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "They have been told and are waiting."<br>
        <br>
        "Are we not to put on our diver's dresses?" asked I.<br>
        <br>
        "Not yet.  I have not allowed the Nautilus to come too near this coast,<br>
        and we are some distance from the Manaar Bank; but the boat is ready,<br>
        and will take us to the exact point of disembarking, which will save us<br>
        a long way.  It carries our diving apparatus, which we will put on when<br>
        we begin our submarine journey."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo conducted me to the central staircase, which led on the<br>
        platform.  Ned and Conseil were already there, delighted at the idea of<br>
        the "pleasure party" which was preparing.  Five sailors from the<br>
        Nautilus, with their oars, waited in the boat, which had been made fast<br>
        against the side.<br>
        <br>
        The night was still dark.  Layers of clouds covered the sky, allowing<br>
        but few stars to be seen.  I looked on the side where the land lay, and<br>
        saw nothing but a dark line enclosing three parts of the horizon, from<br>
        south-west to north west.  The Nautilus, having returned during the<br>
        night up the western coast of Ceylon, was now west of the bay, or<br>
        rather gulf, formed by the mainland and the Island of Manaar.  There,<br>
        under the dark waters, stretched the pintadine bank, an inexhaustible<br>
        field of pearls, the length of which is more than twenty miles.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo, Ned Land, Conseil, and I took our places in the stern of<br>
        the boat.  The master went to the tiller; his four companions leaned on<br>
        their oars, the painter was cast off, and we sheered off.<br>
        <br>
        The boat went towards the south; the oarsmen did not hurry.  I noticed<br>
        that their strokes, strong in the water, only followed each other every<br>
        ten seconds, according to the method generally adopted in the navy.<br>
        Whilst the craft was running by its own velocity, the liquid drops<br>
        struck the dark depths of the waves crisply like spats of melted lead.<br>
        A little billow, spreading wide, gave a slight roll to the boat, and<br>
        some samphire reeds flapped before it.<br>
        <br>
        We were silent.  What was Captain Nemo thinking of?  Perhaps of the<br>
        land he was approaching, and which he found too near to him, contrary<br>
        to the Canadian's opinion, who thought it too far off.  As to Conseil,<br>
        he was merely there from curiosity.<br>
        <br>
        About half-past five the first tints on the horizon showed the upper<br>
        line of coast more distinctly.  Flat enough in the east, it rose a<br>
        little to the south.  Five miles still lay between us, and it was<br>
        indistinct owing to the mist on the water.  At six o'clock it became<br>
        suddenly daylight, with that rapidity peculiar to tropical regions,<br>
        which know neither dawn nor twilight.  The solar rays pierced the<br>
        curtain of clouds, piled up on the eastern horizon, and the radiant orb<br>
        rose rapidly.  I saw land distinctly, with a few trees scattered here<br>
        and there.  The boat neared Manaar Island, which was rounded to the<br>
        south.  Captain Nemo rose from his seat and watched the sea.<br>
        <br>
        At a sign from him the anchor was dropped, but the chain scarcely ran,<br>
        for it was little more than a yard deep, and this spot was one of the<br>
        highest points of the bank of pintadines.<br>
        <br>
        "Here we are, M. Aronnax," said Captain Nemo.  "You see that enclosed<br>
        bay?  Here, in a month will be assembled the numerous fishing boats of<br>
        the exporters, and these are the waters their divers will ransack so<br>
        boldly.  Happily, this bay is well situated for that kind of fishing.<br>
        It is sheltered from the strongest winds; the sea is never very rough<br>
        here, which makes it favourable for the diver's work.  We will now put<br>
        on our dresses, and begin our walk."<br>
        <br>
        I did not answer, and, while watching the suspected waves, began with<br>
        the help of the sailors to put on my heavy sea-dress. Captain Nemo and<br>
        my companions were also dressing.  None of the Nautilus men were to<br>
        accompany us on this new excursion.<br>
        <br>
        Soon we were enveloped to the throat in india-rubber clothing; the air<br>
        apparatus fixed to our backs by braces.  As to the Ruhmkorff apparatus,<br>
        there was no necessity for it.  Before putting my head into the copper<br>
        cap, I had asked the question of the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        "They would be useless," he replied.  "We are going to no great depth,<br>
        and the solar rays will be enough to light our walk.  Besides, it would<br>
        not be prudent to carry the electric light in these waters; its<br>
        brilliancy might attract some of the dangerous inhabitants of the coast<br>
        most inopportunely."<br>
        <br>
        As Captain Nemo pronounced these words, I turned to Conseil and Ned<br>
        Land.  But my two friends had already encased their heads in the metal<br>
        cap, and they could neither hear nor answer.<br>
        <br>
        One last question remained to ask of Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "And our arms?" asked I; "our guns?"<br>
        <br>
        "Guns!  What for?  Do not mountaineers attack the bear with a dagger in<br>
        their hand, and is not steel surer than lead?  Here is a strong blade;<br>
        put it in your belt, and we start."<br>
        <br>
        I looked at my companions; they were armed like us, and, more than<br>
        that, Ned Land was brandishing an enormous harpoon, which he had placed<br>
        in the boat before leaving the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        Then, following the Captain's example, I allowed myself to be dressed<br>
        in the heavy copper helmet, and our reservoirs of air were at once in<br>
        activity.  An instant after we were landed, one after the other, in<br>
        about two yards of water upon an even sand.  Captain Nemo made a sign<br>
        with his hand, and we followed him by a gentle declivity till we<br>
        disappeared under the waves.<br>
        <br>
        Over our feet, like coveys of snipe in a bog, rose shoals of fish, of<br>
        the genus monoptera, which have no other fins but their tail. I<br>
        recognized the Javanese, a real serpent two and a half feet long, of a<br>
        livid colour underneath, and which might easily be mistaken for a<br>
        conger eel if it were not for the golden stripes on its side. In the<br>
        genus stromateus, whose bodies are very flat and oval, I saw some of<br>
        the most brilliant colours, carrying their dorsal fin like a scythe; an<br>
        excellent eating fish, which, dried and pickled, is known by the name<br>
        of Karawade; then some tranquebars, belonging to the genus<br>
        apsiphoroides, whose body is covered with a shell cuirass of eight<br>
        longitudinal plates.<br>
        <br>
        The heightening sun lit the mass of waters more and more. The soil<br>
        changed by degrees. To the fine sand succeeded a perfect causeway of<br>
        boulders, covered with a carpet of molluscs and zoophytes. Amongst the<br>
        specimens of these branches I noticed some placenae, with thin unequal<br>
        shells, a kind of ostracion peculiar to the Red Sea and the Indian<br>
        Ocean; some orange lucinae with rounded shells; rockfish three feet and<br>
        a half long, which raised themselves under the waves like hands ready<br>
        to seize one. There were also some panopyres, slightly luminous; and<br>
        lastly, some oculines, like magnificent fans, forming one of the<br>
        richest vegetations of these seas.<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site4/page4_1131.html>internal_link4_text</a><br><br>
        In the midst of these living plants, and under the arbours of the<br>
        hydrophytes, were layers of clumsy articulates, particularly some<br>
        raninae, whose carapace formed a slightly rounded triangle; and some<br>
        horrible looking parthenopes.<br>
        <br>
        At about seven o'clock we found ourselves at last surveying the<br>
        oyster-banks on which the pearl-oysters are reproduced by millions.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo pointed with his hand to the enormous heap of oysters; and<br>
        I could well understand that this mine was inexhaustible, for Nature's<br>
        creative power is far beyond man's instinct of destruction.  Ned Land,<br>
        faithful to his instinct, hastened to fill a net which he carried by<br>
        his side with some of the finest specimens.  But we could not stop.  We<br>
        must follow the Captain, who seemed to guide him self by paths known<br>
        only to himself.  The ground was sensibly rising, and sometimes, on<br>
        holding up my arm, it was above the surface of the sea.  Then the level<br>
        of the bank would sink capriciously.  Often we rounded high rocks<br>
        scarped into pyramids.  In their dark fractures huge crustacea, perched<br>
        upon their high claws like some war-machine, watched us with fixed<br>
        eyes, and under our feet crawled various kinds of annelides.<br>
        <br>
        At this moment there opened before us a large grotto dug in a<br>
        picturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the<br>
        submarine flora.  At first it seemed very dark to me.  The solar rays<br>
        seemed to be extinguished by successive gradations, until its vague<br>
        transparency became nothing more than drowned light.  Captain Nemo<br>
        entered; we followed.  My eyes soon accustomed themselves to this<br>
        relative state of darkness.  I could distinguish the arches springing<br>
        capriciously from natural pillars, standing broad upon their granite<br>
        base, like the heavy columns of Tuscan architecture.  Why had our<br>
        incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt?  I<br>
        was soon to know.  After descending a rather sharp declivity, our feet<br>
        trod the bottom of a kind of circular pit.  There Captain Nemo stopped,<br>
        and with his hand indicated an object I had not yet perceived.  It was<br>
        an oyster of extraordinary dimensions, a gigantic tridacne, a goblet<br>
        which could have contained a whole lake of holy-water, a basin the<br>
        breadth of which was more than two yards and a half, and consequently<br>
        larger than that ornamenting the saloon of the Nautilus.  I approached<br>
        this extraordinary mollusc.  It adhered by its filaments to a table of<br>
        granite, and there, isolated, it developed itself in the calm waters of<br>
        the grotto.  I estimated the weight of this tridacne at 600 lb.  Such<br>
        an oyster would contain 30 lb. of meat; and one must have the stomach<br>
        of a Gargantua to demolish some dozens of them.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo was evidently acquainted with the existence of this<br>
        bivalve, and seemed to have a particular motive in verifying the actual<br>
        state of this tridacne.  The shells were a little open; the Captain<br>
        came near and put his dagger between to prevent them from closing; then<br>
        with his hand he raised the membrane with its fringed edges, which<br>
        formed a cloak for the creature.  There, between the folded plaits, I<br>
        saw a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut. Its globular<br>
        shape, perfect clearness, and admirable lustre made it altogether a<br>
        jewel of inestimable value.  Carried away by my curiosity, I stretched<br>
        out my hand to seize it, weigh it, and touch it; but the Captain<br>
        stopped me, made a sign of refusal, and quickly withdrew his dagger,<br>
        and the two shells closed suddenly.  I then understood Captain Nemo's<br>
        intention.  In leaving this pearl hidden in the mantle of the tridacne<br>
        he was allowing it to grow slowly.  Each year the secretions of the<br>
        mollusc would add new concentric circles.  I estimated its value at<br>
        L500,000 at least.<br>
        <br>
        After ten minutes Captain Nemo stopped suddenly.  I thought he had<br>
        halted previously to returning.  No; by a gesture he bade us crouch<br>
        beside him in a deep fracture of the rock, his hand pointed to one part<br>
        of the liquid mass, which I watched attentively.<br>
        <br>
        About five yards from me a shadow appeared, and sank to the ground.<br>
        The disquieting idea of sharks shot through my mind, but I was<br>
        mistaken; and once again it was not a monster of the ocean that we had<br>
        anything to do with.<br>
        <br>
        It was a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I<br>
        suppose, had come to glean before the harvest.  I could see the bottom<br>
        of his canoe anchored some feet above his head.  He dived and went up<br>
        successively.  A stone held between his feet, cut in the shape of a<br>
        sugar loaf, whilst a rope fastened him to his boat, helped him to<br>
        descend more rapidly.  This was all his apparatus.  Reaching the<br>
        bottom, about five yards deep, he went on his knees and filled his bag<br>
        with oysters picked up at random.  Then he went up, emptied it, pulled<br>
        up his stone, and began the operation once more, which lasted thirty<br>
        seconds.<br>
        <br>
        The diver did not see us.  The shadow of the rock hid us from sight.<br>
        And how should this poor Indian ever dream that men, beings like<br>
        himself, should be there under the water watching his movements and<br>
        losing no detail of the fishing?  Several times he went up in this way,<br>
        and dived again.  He did not carry away more than ten at each plunge,<br>
        for he was obliged to pull them from the bank to which they adhered by<br>
        means of their strong byssus.  And how many of those oysters for which<br>
        he risked his life had no pearl in them!  I watched him closely; his<br>
        manoeuvres were regular; and for the space of half an hour no danger<br>
        appeared to threaten him.<br>
        <br>
        I was beginning to accustom myself to the sight of this interesting<br>
        fishing, when suddenly, as the Indian was on the ground, I saw him make<br>
        a gesture of terror, rise, and make a spring to return to the surface<br>
        of the sea.<br>
        <br>
        I understood his dread.  A gigantic shadow appeared just above the<br>
        unfortunate diver.  It was a shark of enormous size advancing<br>
        diagonally, his eyes on fire, and his jaws open.  I was mute with<br>
        horror and unable to move.<br>
        <br>
        The voracious creature shot towards the Indian, who threw himself on<br>
        one side to avoid the shark's fins; but not its tail, for it struck his<br>
        chest and stretched him on the ground.<br>
        <br>
        This scene lasted but a few seconds:  the shark returned, and, turning<br>
        on his back, prepared himself for cutting the Indian in two, when I saw<br>
        Captain Nemo rise suddenly, and then, dagger in hand, walk straight to<br>
        the monster, ready to fight face to face with him.  The very moment the<br>
        shark was going to snap the unhappy fisherman in two, he perceived his<br>
        new adversary, and, turning over, made straight towards him.<br>
        <br>
        I can still see Captain Nemo's position.  Holding himself well<br>
        together, he waited for the shark with admirable coolness; and, when it<br>
        rushed at him, threw himself on one side with wonderful quickness,<br>
        avoiding the shock, and burying his dagger deep into its side.  But it<br>
        was not all over.  A terrible combat ensued.<br>
        <br>
        The shark had seemed to roar, if I might say so.  The blood rushed in<br>
        torrents from its wound.  The sea was dyed red, and through the opaque<br>
        liquid I could distinguish nothing more.  Nothing more until the moment<br>
        when, like lightning, I saw the undaunted Captain hanging on to one of<br>
        the creature's fins, struggling, as it were, hand to hand with the<br>
        monster, and dealing successive blows at his enemy, yet still unable to<br>
        give a decisive one.<br>
        <br>
        The shark's struggles agitated the water with such fury that the<br>
        rocking threatened to upset me.<br>
        <br>
        I wanted to go to the Captain's assistance, but, nailed to the spot<br>
        with horror, I could not stir.<br>
        <br>
        I saw the haggard eye; I saw the different phases of the fight.  The<br>
        Captain fell to the earth, upset by the enormous mass which leant upon<br>
        him.  The shark's jaws opened wide, like a pair of factory shears, and<br>
        it would have been all over with the Captain; but, quick as thought,<br>
        harpoon in hand, Ned Land rushed towards the shark and struck it with<br>
        its sharp point.<br>
        <br>
        The waves were impregnated with a mass of blood.  They rocked under the<br>
        shark's movements, which beat them with indescribable fury.  Ned Land<br>
        had not missed his aim.  It was the monster's death-rattle.  Struck to<br>
        the heart, it struggled in dreadful convulsions, the shock of which<br>
        overthrew Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        But Ned Land had disentangled the Captain, who, getting up without any<br>
        wound, went straight to the Indian, quickly cut the cord which held him<br>
        to his stone, took him in his arms, and, with a sharp blow of his heel,<br>
        mounted to the surface.<br>
        <br>
        We all three followed in a few seconds, saved by a miracle, and reached<br>
        the fisherman's boat.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo's first care was to recall the unfortunate man to life<br>
        again.  I did not think he could succeed.  I hoped so, for the poor<br>
        creature's immersion was not long; but the blow from the shark's tail<br>
        might have been his death-blow.<br>
        <br>
        Happily, with the Captain's and Conseil's sharp friction, I saw<br>
        consciousness return by degrees.  He opened his eyes.  What was his<br>
        surprise, his terror even, at seeing four great copper heads leaning<br>
        over him!  And, above all, what must he have thought when Captain Nemo,<br>
        drawing from the pocket of his dress a bag of pearls, placed it in his<br>
        hand!  This munificent charity from the man of the waters to the poor<br>
        Cingalese was accepted with a trembling hand.  His wondering eyes<br>
        showed that he knew not to what super-human beings he owed both fortune<br>
        and life.<br>
        <br>
        At a sign from the Captain we regained the bank, and, following the<br>
        road already traversed, came in about half an hour to the anchor which<br>
        held the canoe of the Nautilus to the earth.<br>
        <br>
        Once on board, we each, with the help of the sailors, got rid of the<br>
        heavy copper helmet.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo's first word was to the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Thank you, Master Land," said he.<br>
        <br>
        "It was in revenge, Captain," replied Ned Land.  "I owed you that."<br>
        <br>
        A ghastly smile passed across the Captain's lips, and that was all.<br>
        <br>
        "To the Nautilus," said he.<br>
        <br>
        The boat flew over the waves.  Some minutes after we met the shark's<br>
        dead body floating.  By the black marking of the extremity of its fins,<br>
        I recognised the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the<br>
        species of shark so properly called.  It was more than twenty-five feet<br>
        long; its enormous mouth occupied one-third of its body.  It was an<br>
        adult, as was known by its six rows of teeth placed in an isosceles<br>
        triangle in the upper jaw.<br>
        <br>
        Whilst I was contemplating this inert mass, a dozen of these voracious<br>
        beasts appeared round the boat; and, without noticing us, threw<br>
        themselves upon the dead body and fought with one another for the<br>
        pieces.<br>
        <br>
        At half-past eight we were again on board the Nautilus.  There I<br>
        reflected on the incidents which had taken place in our excursion to<br>
        the Manaar Bank.<br>
        <br>
        Two conclusions I must inevitably draw from it--one bearing upon the<br>
        unparalleled courage of Captain Nemo, the other upon his devotion to a<br>
        human being, a representative of that race from which he fled beneath<br>
        the sea.  Whatever he might say, this strange man had not yet succeeded<br>
        in entirely crushing his heart.<br>
        <br>
        When I made this observation to him, he answered in a slightly moved<br>
        tone:<br>
        <br>
        "That Indian, sir, is an inhabitant of an oppressed country; and I am<br>
        still, and shall be, to my last breath, one of them!"<br>
        <br>
        <br>
