        to his stone, took him in his arms, and, with a sharp blow of his heel,<br>
        mounted to the surface.<br>
        <br>
        We all three followed in a few seconds, saved by a miracle, and reached<br>
        the fisherman's boat.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo's first care was to recall the unfortunate man to life<br>
        again.  I did not think he could succeed.  I hoped so, for the poor<br>
        creature's immersion was not long; but the blow from the shark's tail<br>
        might have been his death-blow.<br>
        <br>
        Happily, with the Captain's and Conseil's sharp friction, I saw<br>
        consciousness return by degrees.  He opened his eyes.  What was his<br>
        surprise, his terror even, at seeing four great copper heads leaning<br>
        over him!  And, above all, what must he have thought when Captain Nemo,<br>
        drawing from the pocket of his dress a bag of pearls, placed it in his<br>
        hand!  This munificent charity from the man of the waters to the poor<br>
        Cingalese was accepted with a trembling hand.  His wondering eyes<br>
        showed that he knew not to what super-human beings he owed both fortune<br>
        and life.<br>
        <br>
        At a sign from the Captain we regained the bank, and, following the<br>
        road already traversed, came in about half an hour to the anchor which<br>
        held the canoe of the Nautilus to the earth.<br>
        <br>
        Once on board, we each, with the help of the sailors, got rid of the<br>
        heavy copper helmet.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo's first word was to the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Thank you, Master Land," said he.<br>
        <br>
        "It was in revenge, Captain," replied Ned Land.  "I owed you that."<br>
        <br>
        A ghastly smile passed across the Captain's lips, and that was all.<br>
        <br>
        "To the Nautilus," said he.<br>
        <br>
        The boat flew over the waves.  Some minutes after we met the shark's<br>
        dead body floating.  By the black marking of the extremity of its fins,<br>
        I recognised the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the<br>
        species of shark so properly called.  It was more than twenty-five feet<br>
        long; its enormous mouth occupied one-third of its body.  It was an<br>
        adult, as was known by its six rows of teeth placed in an isosceles<br>
        triangle in the upper jaw.<br>
        <br>
        Whilst I was contemplating this inert mass, a dozen of these voracious<br>
        beasts appeared round the boat; and, without noticing us, threw<br>
        themselves upon the dead body and fought with one another for the<br>
        pieces.<br>
        <br>
        At half-past eight we were again on board the Nautilus.  There I<br>
        reflected on the incidents which had taken place in our excursion to<br>
        the Manaar Bank.<br>
        <br>
        Two conclusions I must inevitably draw from it--one bearing upon the<br>
        unparalleled courage of Captain Nemo, the other upon his devotion to a<br>
        human being, a representative of that race from which he fled beneath<br>
        the sea.  Whatever he might say, this strange man had not yet succeeded<br>
        in entirely crushing his heart.<br>
        <br>
        When I made this observation to him, he answered in a slightly moved<br>
        tone:<br>
        <br>
        "That Indian, sir, is an inhabitant of an oppressed country; and I am<br>
        still, and shall be, to my last breath, one of them!"<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER IV<br>
        <br>
        THE RED SEA<br>
        <br>
        In the course of the day of the 29th of January, the island of Ceylon<br>
        disappeared under the horizon, and the Nautilus, at a speed of twenty<br>
        miles an hour, slid into the labyrinth of canals which separate the<br>
        Maldives from the Laccadives.  It coasted even the Island of Kiltan, a<br>
        land originally coraline, discovered by Vasco da Gama in 1499, and one<br>
        of the nineteen principal islands of the Laccadive Archipelago,<br>
        situated between 10° and 14° 30' N. lat., and 69° 50' 72"<br>
        E. long.<br>
        <br>
        We had made 16,220 miles, or 7,500 (French) leagues from our<br>
        starting-point in the Japanese Seas.<br>
        <br>
        The next day (30th January), when the Nautilus went to the surface of<br>
        the ocean there was no land in sight.  Its course was N.N.E., in the<br>
        direction of the Sea of Oman, between Arabia and the Indian Peninsula,<br>
        which serves as an outlet to the Persian Gulf.  It was evidently a<br>
        block without any possible egress.  Where was Captain Nemo taking us<br>
        to?  I could not say.  This, however, did not satisfy the Canadian, who<br>
        that day came to me asking where we were going.<br>
        <br>
        "We are going where our Captain's fancy takes us, Master Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "His fancy cannot take us far, then," said the Canadian.  "The Persian<br>
        Gulf has no outlet:  and, if we do go in, it will not be long before we<br>
        are out again."<br>
        <br>
        "Very well, then, we will come out again, Master Land; and if, after<br>
        the Persian Gulf, the Nautilus would like to visit the Red Sea, the<br>
        Straits of Bab-el-mandeb are there to give us entrance."<br>
        <br>
        "I need not tell you, sir," said Ned Land, "that the Red Sea is as much<br>
        closed as the Gulf, as the Isthmus of Suez is not yet cut; and, if it<br>
        was, a boat as mysterious as ours would not risk itself in a canal cut<br>
        with sluices.  And again, the Red Sea is not the road to take us back<br>
        to Europe."<br>
        <br>
        "But I never said we were going back to Europe."<br>
        <br>
        "What do you suppose, then?"<br>
        <br>
        "I suppose that, after visiting the curious coasts of Arabia and Egypt,<br>
        the Nautilus will go down the Indian Ocean again, perhaps cross the<br>
        Channel of Mozambique, perhaps off the Mascarenhas, so as to gain the<br>
        Cape of Good Hope."<br>
        <br>
        "And once at the Cape of Good Hope?" asked the Canadian, with peculiar<br>
        emphasis.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, we shall penetrate into that Atlantic which we do not yet know.<br>
        Ah! friend Ned, you are getting tired of this journey under the sea;<br>
        you are surfeited with the incessantly varying spectacle of submarine<br>
        wonders.  For my part, I shall be sorry to see the end of a voyage<br>
        which it is given to so few men to make."<br>
        <br>
        For four days, till the 3rd of February, the Nautilus scoured the Sea<br>
        of Oman, at various speeds and at various depths.  It seemed to go at<br>
        random, as if hesitating as to which road it should follow, but we<br>
        never passed the Tropic of Cancer.<br>
        <br>
        In quitting this sea we sighted Muscat for an instant, one of the most<br>
        important towns of the country of Oman.  I admired its strange aspect,<br>
        surrounded by black rocks upon which its white houses and forts stood<br>
        in relief.  I saw the rounded domes of its mosques, the elegant points<br>
        of its minarets, its fresh and verdant terraces.  But it was only a<br>
        vision!  The Nautilus soon sank under the waves of that part of the sea.<br>
        <br>
        We passed along the Arabian coast of Mahrah and Hadramaut, for a<br>
        distance of six miles, its undulating line of mountains being<br>
        occasionally relieved by some ancient ruin.  The 5th of February we at<br>
        last entered the Gulf of Aden, a perfect funnel introduced into the<br>
        neck of Bab-el-mandeb, through which the Indian waters entered the Red<br>
        Sea.<br>
        <br>
        The 6th of February, the Nautilus floated in sight of Aden, perched<br>
        upon a promontory which a narrow isthmus joins to the mainland, a kind<br>
        of inaccessible Gibraltar, the fortifications of which were rebuilt by<br>
        the English after taking possession in 1839.  I caught a glimpse of the<br>
        octagon minarets of this town, which was at one time the richest<br>
        commercial magazine on the coast.<br>
        <br>
        I certainly thought that Captain Nemo, arrived at this point, would<br>
        back out again; but I was mistaken, for he did no such thing, much to<br>
        my surprise.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 7th of February, we entered the Straits of<br>
        Bab-el-mandeb, the name of which, in the Arab tongue, means The Gate of<br>
        Tears.<br>
        <br>
        To twenty miles in breadth, it is only thirty-two in length.  And for<br>
        the Nautilus, starting at full speed, the crossing was scarcely the<br>
        work of an hour.  But I saw nothing, not even the Island of Perim, with<br>
        which the British Government has fortified the position of Aden.  There<br>
        were too many English or French steamers of the line of Suez to Bombay,<br>
        Calcutta to Melbourne, and from Bourbon to the Mauritius, furrowing<br>
        this narrow passage, for the Nautilus to venture to show itself.  So it<br>
        remained prudently below.  At last about noon, we were in the waters of<br>
        the Red Sea.<br>
        <br>
        I would not even seek to understand the caprice which had decided<br>
        Captain Nemo upon entering the gulf.  But I quite approved of the<br>
        Nautilus entering it.  Its speed was lessened:  sometimes it kept on<br>
        the surface, sometimes it dived to avoid a vessel, and thus I was able<br>
        to observe the upper and lower parts of this curious sea.<br>
        <br>
        The 8th of February, from the first dawn of day, Mocha came in sight,<br>
        now a ruined town, whose walls would fall at a gunshot, yet which<br>
        shelters here and there some verdant date-trees; once an important<br>
        city, containing six public markets, and twenty-six mosques, and whose<br>
        walls, defended by fourteen forts, formed a girdle of two miles in<br>
        circumference.<br>
        <br>
        The Nautilus then approached the African shore, where the depth of the<br>
        sea was greater.  There, between two waters clear as crystal, through<br>
        the open panels we were allowed to contemplate the beautiful bushes of<br>
        brilliant coral and large blocks of rock clothed with a splendid fur of<br>
        green variety of sites and landscapes along these sandbanks and algae<br>
        and fuci.  What an indescribable spectacle, and what variety of sites<br>
        and landscapes along these sandbanks and volcanic islands which bound<br>
        the Libyan coast!  But where these shrubs appeared in all their beauty<br>
        was on the eastern coast, which the Nautilus soon gained.  It was on<br>
        the coast of Tehama, for there not only did this display of zoophytes<br>
        flourish beneath the level of the sea, but they also formed picturesque<br>
        interlacings which unfolded themselves about sixty feet above the<br>
        surface, more capricious but less highly coloured than those whose<br>
        freshness was kept up by the vital power of the waters.<br>
        <br>
        What charming hours I passed thus at the window of the saloon!  What<br>
        new specimens of submarine flora and fauna did I admire under the<br>
        brightness of our electric lantern!<br>
        <br>
        The 9th of February the Nautilus floated in the broadest part of the<br>
        Red Sea, which is comprised between Souakin, on the west coast, and<br>
        Komfidah, on the east coast, with a diameter of ninety miles.<br>
        <br>
        That day at noon, after the bearings were taken, Captain Nemo mounted<br>
        the platform, where I happened to be, and I was determined not to let<br>
        him go down again without at least pressing him regarding his ulterior<br>
        projects.  As soon as he saw me he approached and graciously offered me<br>
        a cigar.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, sir, does this Red Sea please you?  Have you sufficiently<br>
        observed the wonders it covers, its fishes, its zoophytes, its<br>
        parterres of sponges, and its forests of coral?  Did you catch a<br>
        glimpse of the towns on its borders?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Captain Nemo," I replied; "and the Nautilus is wonderfully fitted<br>
        for such a study.  Ah! it is an intelligent boat!"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir, intelligent and invulnerable.  It fears neither the terrible<br>
        tempests of the Red Sea, nor its currents, nor its sandbanks."<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly," said I, "this sea is quoted as one of the worst, and in<br>
        the time of the ancients, if I am not mistaken, its reputation was<br>
        detestable."<br>
        <br>
        "Detestable, M. Aronnax.  The Greek and Latin historians do not speak<br>
        favourably of it, and Strabo says it is very dangerous during the<br>
        Etesian winds and in the rainy season.  The Arabian Edrisi portrays it<br>
        under the name of the Gulf of Colzoum, and relates that vessels<br>
        perished there in great numbers on the sandbanks and that no one would<br>
        risk sailing in the night.  It is, he pretends, a sea subject to<br>
        fearful hurricanes, strewn with inhospitable islands, and `which offers<br>
        nothing good either on its surface or in its depths.'"<br>
        <br>
        "One may see," I replied, "that these historians never sailed on board<br>
        the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        "Just so," replied the Captain, smiling; "and in that respect moderns<br>
        are not more advanced than the ancients.  It required many ages to find<br>
        out the mechanical power of steam.  Who knows if, in another hundred<br>
        years, we may not see a second Nautilus?  Progress is slow, M. Aronnax."<br>
        <br>
        "It is true," I answered; "your boat is at least a century before its<br>
        time, perhaps an era.  What a misfortune that the secret of such an<br>
        invention should die with its inventor!"<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo did not reply.  After some minutes' silence he continued:<br>
        <br>
        "You were speaking of the opinions of ancient historians upon the<br>
        dangerous navigation of the Red Sea."<br>
        <br>
        "It is true," said I; "but were not their fears exaggerated?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes and no, M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo, who seemed to know the<br>
        Red Sea by heart.  "That which is no longer dangerous for a modern<br>
        vessel, well rigged, strongly built, and master of its own course,<br>
        thanks to obedient steam, offered all sorts of perils to the ships of<br>
        the ancients.  Picture to yourself those first navigators venturing in<br>
        ships made of planks sewn with the cords of the palmtree, saturated<br>
        with the grease of the seadog, and covered with powdered resin!  They<br>
        had not even instruments wherewith to take their bearings, and they<br>
        went by guess amongst currents of which they scarcely knew anything.<br>
        Under such conditions shipwrecks were, and must have been, numerous.<br>
        But in our time, steamers running between Suez and the South Seas have<br>
        nothing more to fear from the fury of this gulf, in spite of contrary<br>
        trade-winds. The captain and passengers do not prepare for their<br>
        departure by offering propitiatory sacrifices; and, on their return,<br>
        they no longer go ornamented with wreaths and gilt fillets to thank the<br>
        gods in the neighbouring temple."<br>
        <br>
        "I agree with you," said I; "and steam seems to have killed all<br>
        gratitude in the hearts of sailors.  But, Captain, since you seem to<br>
        have especially studied this sea, can you tell me the origin of its<br>
        name?"<br>
        <br>
        "There exist several explanations on the subject, M. Aronnax.  Would<br>
        you like to know the opinion of a chronicler of the fourteenth century?"<br>
        <br>
        "Willingly."<br>
        <br>
        "This fanciful writer pretends that its name was given to it after the<br>
        passage of the Israelites, when Pharaoh perished in the waves which<br>
        closed at the voice of Moses."<br>
        <br>
        "A poet's explanation, Captain Nemo," I replied; "but I cannot content<br>
        myself with that.  I ask you for your personal opinion."<br>
        <br>
        "Here it is, M. Aronnax.  According to my idea, we must see in this<br>
        appellation of the Red Sea a translation of the Hebrew word `Edom'; and<br>
        if the ancients gave it that name, it was on account of the particular<br>
        colour of its waters."<br>
        <a href=../site3/page3_848.html>external_link0_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        "But up to this time I have seen nothing but transparent waves and<br>
        without any particular colour."<br>
        <br>
        "Very likely; but as we advance to the bottom of the gulf, you will see<br>
        this singular appearance.  I remember seeing the Bay of Tor entirely<br>
        red, like a sea of blood."<br>
        <br>
        "And you attribute this colour to the presence of a microscopic<br>
        seaweed?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes."<br>
        <br>
        "So, Captain Nemo, it is not the first time you have overrun the Red<br>
        Sea on board the Nautilus?"<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "As you spoke a while ago of the passage of the Israelites and of the<br>
        catastrophe to the Egyptians, I will ask whether you have met with the<br>
        traces under the water of this great historical fact?"<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir; and for a good reason."<br>
        <br>
        "What is it?"<br>
        <br>
        "It is that the spot where Moses and his people passed is now so<br>
        blocked up with sand that the camels can barely bathe their legs there.<br>
        You can well understand that there would not be water enough for my<br>
        Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        "And the spot?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "The spot is situated a little above the Isthmus of Suez, in the arm<br>
        which formerly made a deep estuary, when the Red Sea extended to the<br>
        Salt Lakes.  Now, whether this passage were miraculous or not, the<br>
        Israelites, nevertheless, crossed there to reach the Promised Land, and<br>
        Pharaoh's army perished precisely on that spot; and I think that<br>
        excavations made in the middle of the sand would bring to light a large<br>
        number of arms and instruments of Egyptian origin."<br>
        <br>
        "That is evident," I replied; "and for the sake of archaeologists let<br>
        us hope that these excavations will be made sooner or later, when new<br>
        towns are established on the isthmus, after the construction of the<br>
        Suez Canal; a canal, however, very useless to a vessel like the<br>
        Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        "Very likely; but useful to the whole world," said Captain Nemo.  "The<br>
        ancients well understood the utility of a communication between the Red<br>
        Sea and the Mediterranean for their commercial affairs: but they did<br>
        not think of digging a canal direct, and took the Nile as an<br>
        intermediate.  Very probably the canal which united the Nile to the Red<br>
        Sea was begun by Sesostris, if we may believe tradition.  One thing is<br>
        certain, that in the year 615 before Jesus Christ, Necos undertook the<br>
        works of an alimentary canal to the waters of the Nile across the plain<br>
        of Egypt, looking towards Arabia.  It took four days to go up this<br>
        canal, and it was so wide that two triremes could go abreast.  It was<br>
        carried on by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, and probably finished by<br>
        Ptolemy II.  Strabo saw it navigated:  but its decline from the point<br>
        of departure, near Bubastes, to the Red Sea was so slight that it was<br>
        only navigable for a few months in the year.  This canal answered all<br>
        commercial purposes to the age of Antonius, when it was abandoned and<br>
        blocked up with sand.  Restored by order of the Caliph Omar, it was<br>
        definitely destroyed in 761 or 762 by Caliph Al-Mansor, who wished to<br>
        prevent the arrival of provisions to Mohammed-ben-Abdallah, who had<br>
        revolted against him.  During the expedition into Egypt, your General<br>
        Bonaparte discovered traces of the works in the Desert of Suez; and,<br>
        surprised by the tide, he nearly perished before regaining Hadjaroth,<br>
        at the very place where Moses had encamped three thousand years before<br>
        him."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Captain, what the ancients dared not undertake, this junction<br>
        between the two seas, which will shorten the road from Cadiz to India,<br>
        M. Lesseps has succeeded in doing; and before long he will have changed<br>
        Africa into an immense island."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, M. Aronnax; you have the right to be proud of your countryman.<br>
        Such a man brings more honour to a nation than great captains.  He<br>
        began, like so many others, with disgust and rebuffs; but he has<br>
        triumphed, for he has the genius of will.  And it is sad to think that<br>
        a work like that, which ought to have been an international work and<br>
        which would have sufficed to make a reign illustrious, should have<br>
        succeeded by the energy of one man.  All honour to M. Lesseps!"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes! honour to the great citizen," I replied, surprised by the manner<br>
        in which Captain Nemo had just spoken.<br>
        <br>
        "Unfortunately," he continued, "I cannot take you through the Suez<br>
        Canal; but you will be able to see the long jetty of Port Said after<br>
        to-morrow, when we shall be in the Mediterranean."<br>
        <br>
        "The Mediterranean!"  I exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir; does that astonish you?"<br>
        <br>
        "What astonishes me is to think that we shall be there the day after<br>
        to-morrow."<br>
        <br>
        "Indeed?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Captain, although by this time I ought to have accustomed myself<br>
        to be surprised at nothing since I have been on board your boat."<br>
        <br>
        "But the cause of this surprise?"<br>
        <br>
        "Well! it is the fearful speed you will have to put on the Nautilus, if<br>
        the day after to-morrow she is to be in the Mediterranean, having made<br>
        the round of Africa, and doubled the Cape of Good Hope!"<br>
        <br>
        "Who told you that she would make the round of Africa and double the<br>
        Cape of Good Hope, sir?"<br>
        <br>
        "Well, unless the Nautilus sails on dry land, and passes above the<br>
        isthmus----"<br>
        <br>
        "Or beneath it, M. Aronnax."<br>
        <br>
        "Beneath it?"<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly," replied Captain Nemo quietly.  "A long time ago Nature<br>
        made under this tongue of land what man has this day made on its<br>
        surface."<br>
        <br>
        "What! such a passage exists?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes; a subterranean passage, which I have named the Arabian Tunnel.<br>
        It takes us beneath Suez and opens into the Gulf of Pelusium."<br>
        <br>
        "But this isthmus is composed of nothing but quick sands?"<br>
        <br>
        "To a certain depth.  But at fifty-five yards only there is a solid<br>
        layer of rock."<br>
        <br>
        "Did you discover this passage by chance?"  I asked more and more<br>
        surprised.<br>
        <br>
        "Chance and reasoning, sir; and by reasoning even more than by chance.<br>
        Not only does this passage exist, but I have profited by it several<br>
        times.  Without that I should not have ventured this day into the<br>
        impassable Red Sea.  I noticed that in the Red Sea and in the<br>
        Mediterranean there existed a certain number of fishes of a kind<br>
        perfectly identical.  Certain of the fact, I asked myself was it<br>
        possible that there was no communication between the two seas?  If<br>
        there was, the subterranean current must necessarily run from the Red<br>
        Sea to the Mediterranean, from the sole cause of difference of level.<br>
        I caught a large number of fishes in the neighbourhood of Suez.  I<br>
        passed a copper ring through their tails, and threw them back into the<br>
        sea.  Some months later, on the coast of Syria, I caught some of my<br>
        fish ornamented with the ring.  Thus the communication between the two<br>
        was proved.  I then sought for it with my Nautilus; I discovered it,<br>
        ventured into it, and before long, sir, you too will have passed<br>
        through my Arabian tunnel!"<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER V<br>
        <br>
        THE ARABIAN TUNNEL<br>
        <br>
        That same evening, in 21° 30' N. lat., the Nautilus floated on the<br>
        surface of the sea, approaching the Arabian coast.  I saw Djeddah, the<br>
        most important counting-house of Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and India.  I<br>
        distinguished clearly enough its buildings, the vessels anchored at the<br>
        quays, and those whose draught of water obliged them to anchor in the<br>
        roads.  The sun, rather low on the horizon, struck full on the houses<br>
        of the town, bringing out their whiteness.  Outside, some wooden<br>
        cabins, and some made of reeds, showed the quarter inhabited by the<br>
        Bedouins.  Soon Djeddah was shut out from view by the shadows of night,<br>
        and the Nautilus found herself under water slightly phosphorescent.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 10th of February, we sighted several ships running to<br>
        windward.  The Nautilus returned to its submarine navigation; but at<br>
        noon, when her bearings were taken, the sea being deserted, she rose<br>
        again to her waterline.<br>
        <br>
        Accompanied by Ned and Conseil, I seated myself on the platform.  The<br>
        coast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a<br>
        damp fog.<br>
        <br>
        We were leaning on the sides of the pinnace, talking of one thing and<br>
        another, when Ned Land, stretching out his hand towards a spot on the<br>
        sea, said:<br>
        <br>
        "Do you see anything there, sir?"<br>
        <br>
        "No, Ned," I replied; "but I have not your eyes, you know."<br>
        <br>
        "Look well," said Ned, "there, on the starboard beam, about the height<br>
        of the lantern!  Do you not see a mass which seems to move?"<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly," said I, after close attention; "I see something like a<br>
        long black body on the top of the water."<br>
        <br>
        And certainly before long the black object was not more than a mile<br>
        from us.  It looked like a great sandbank deposited in the open sea.<br>
        It was a gigantic dugong!<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land looked eagerly.  His eyes shone with covetousness at the sight<br>
        of the animal.  His hand seemed ready to harpoon it.  One would have<br>
        thought he was awaiting the moment to throw himself into the sea and<br>
        attack it in its element.<br>
        <br>
        At this instant Captain Nemo appeared on the platform.  He saw the<br>
        dugong, understood the Canadian's attitude, and, addressing him, said:<br>
        <br>
        "If you held a harpoon just now, Master Land, would it not burn your<br>
        hand?"<br>
        <br>
        "Just so, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "And you would not be sorry to go back, for one day, to your trade of a<br>
        fisherman and to add this cetacean to the list of those you have<br>
        already killed?"<br>
        <br>
        "I should not, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, you can try."<br>
        <br>
        "Thank you, sir," said Ned Land, his eyes flaming.<br>
        <br>
        "Only," continued the Captain, "I advise you for your own sake not to<br>
        miss the creature."<br>
        <br>
        "Is the dugong dangerous to attack?"  I asked, in spite of the<br>
        Canadian's shrug of the shoulders.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," replied the Captain; "sometimes the animal turns upon its<br>
        assailants and overturns their boat.  But for Master Land this danger<br>
        is not to be feared.  His eye is prompt, his arm sure."<br>
        <br>
        At this moment seven men of the crew, mute and immovable as ever,<br>
        mounted the platform.  One carried a harpoon and a line similar to<br>
        those employed in catching whales.  The pinnace was lifted from the<br>
        bridge, pulled from its socket, and let down into the sea.  Six oarsmen<br>
        took their seats, and the coxswain went to the tiller.  Ned, Conseil,<br>
        and I went to the back of the boat.<br>
        <br>
        "You are not coming, Captain?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir; but I wish you good sport."<br>
        <br>
        The boat put off, and, lifted by the six rowers, drew rapidly towards<br>
        the dugong, which floated about two miles from the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        Arrived some cables-length from the cetacean, the speed slackened, and<br>
        the oars dipped noiselessly into the quiet waters.  Ned Land, harpoon<br>
        in hand, stood in the fore part of the boat.  The harpoon used for<br>
        striking the whale is generally attached to a very long cord which runs<br>
        out rapidly as the wounded creature draws it after him.  But here the<br>
        cord was not more than ten fathoms long, and the extremity was attached<br>
        to a small barrel which, by floating, was to show the course the dugong<br>
        took under the water.<br>
        <br>
        I stood and carefully watched the Canadian's adversary.  This dugong,<br>
        which also bears the name of the halicore, closely resembles the<br>
        manatee; its oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail, and its<br>
        lateral fins in perfect fingers.  Its difference from the manatee<br>
        consisted in its upper jaw, which was armed with two long and pointed<br>
        teeth which formed on each side diverging tusks.<br>
        <br>
        This dugong which Ned Land was preparing to attack was of colossal<br>
        dimensions; it was more than seven yards long.  It did not move, and<br>
        seemed to be sleeping on the waves, which circumstance made it easier<br>
        to capture.<br>
        <br>
        The boat approached within six yards of the animal.  The oars rested on<br>
        the rowlocks.  I half rose.  Ned Land, his body thrown a little back,<br>
        brandished the harpoon in his experienced hand.<br>
        <br>
        Suddenly a hissing noise was heard, and the dugong disappeared.  The<br>
        harpoon, although thrown with great force; had apparently only struck<br>
        the water.<br>
        <br>
        "Curse it!" exclaimed the Canadian furiously; "I have missed it!"<br>
        <br>
        "No," said I; "the creature is wounded--look at the blood; but your<br>
        weapon has not stuck in his body."<br>
        <br>
        "My harpoon! my harpoon!" cried Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        The sailors rowed on, and the coxswain made for the floating barrel.<br>
        The harpoon regained, we followed in pursuit of the animal.<br>
        <br>
        The latter came now and then to the surface to breathe.  Its wound had<br>
        not weakened it, for it shot onwards with great rapidity.<br>
        <br>
        The boat, rowed by strong arms, flew on its track.  Several times it<br>
        approached within some few yards, and the Canadian was ready to strike,<br>
        but the dugong made off with a sudden plunge, and it was impossible to<br>
        reach it.<br>
        <br>
        Imagine the passion which excited impatient Ned Land!  He hurled at the<br>
        unfortunate creature the most energetic expletives in the English<br>
        tongue.  For my part, I was only vexed to see the dugong escape all our<br>
        <a href=../site4/page4_2175.html>internal_link1_text</a><br><br>
        attacks.<br>
        <br>
        We pursued it without relaxation for an hour, and I began to think it<br>
        would prove difficult to capture, when the animal, possessed with the<br>
        perverse idea of vengeance of which he had cause to repent, turned upon<br>
        the pinnace and assailed us in its turn.<br>
        <br>
        This manoeuvre did not escape the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Look out!" he cried.<br>
        <br>
        The coxswain said some words in his outlandish tongue, doubtless<br>
        warning the men to keep on their guard.<br>
        <br>
        The dugong came within twenty feet of the boat, stopped, sniffed the<br>
        air briskly with its large nostrils (not pierced at the extremity, but<br>
        in the upper part of its muzzle). Then, taking a spring, he threw<br>
        himself upon us.<br>
        <br>
        The pinnace could not avoid the shock, and half upset, shipped at least<br>
        two tons of water, which had to be emptied; but, thanks to the<br>
        coxswain, we caught it sideways, not full front, so we were not quite<br>
        overturned.  While Ned Land, clinging to the bows, belaboured the<br>
        gigantic animal with blows from his harpoon, the creature's teeth were<br>
        buried in the gunwale, and it lifted the whole thing out of the water,<br>
        as a lion does a roebuck.  We were upset over one another, and I know<br>
        not how the adventure would have ended, if the Canadian, still enraged<br>
        with the beast, had not struck it to the heart.<br>
        <br>
        I heard its teeth grind on the iron plate, and the dugong disappeared,<br>
        carrying the harpoon with him.  But the barrel soon returned to the<br>
        surface, and shortly after the body of the animal, turned on its back.<br>
        The boat came up with it, took it in tow, and made straight for the<br>
        Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        It required tackle of enormous strength to hoist the dugong on to the<br>
        platform.  It weighed 10,000 lb.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, 11th February, the larder of the Nautilus was enriched by<br>
        some more delicate game.  A flight of sea-swallows rested on the<br>
        Nautilus.  It was a species of the Sterna nilotica, peculiar to Egypt;<br>
        its beak is black, head grey and pointed, the eye surrounded by white<br>
        spots, the back, wings, and tail of a greyish colour, the belly and<br>
        throat white, and claws red.  They also took some dozen of Nile ducks,<br>
        a wild bird of high flavour, its throat and upper part of the head<br>
        white with black spots.<br>
        <br>
        About five o'clock in the evening we sighted to the north the Cape of<br>
        Ras-Mohammed. This cape forms the extremity of Arabia Petraea,<br>
        comprised between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Acabah.<br>
        <br>
        The Nautilus penetrated into the Straits of Jubal, which leads to the<br>
        Gulf of Suez.  I distinctly saw a high mountain, towering between the<br>
        two gulfs of Ras-Mohammed. It was Mount Horeb, that Sinai at the top of<br>
        which Moses saw God face to face.<br>
        <br>
        At six o'clock the Nautilus, sometimes floating, sometimes immersed,<br>
        passed some distance from Tor, situated at the end of the bay, the<br>
        waters of which seemed tinted with red, an observation already made by<br>
        Captain Nemo.  Then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence,<br>
        sometimes broken by the cries of the pelican and other night-birds, and<br>
        the noise of the waves breaking upon the shore, chafing against the<br>
        rocks, or the panting of some far-off steamer beating the waters of the<br>
        Gulf with its noisy paddles.<br>
        <br>
        From eight to nine o'clock the Nautilus remained some fathoms under the<br>
        water.  According to my calculation we must have been very near Suez.<br>
        Through the panel of the saloon I saw the bottom of the rocks<br>
        brilliantly lit up by our electric lamp.  We seemed to be leaving the<br>
        Straits behind us more and more.<br>
        <br>
        At a quarter-past nine, the vessel having returned to the surface, I<br>
        mounted the platform.  Most impatient to pass through Captain Nemo's<br>
        tunnel, I could not stay in one place, so came to breathe the fresh<br>
        night air.<br>
        <br>
        Soon in the shadow I saw a pale light, half discoloured by the fog,<br>
        shining about a mile from us.<br>
        <br>
        "A floating lighthouse!" said someone near me.<br>
        <br>
        I turned, and saw the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        "It is the floating light of Suez," he continued.  "It will not be long<br>
        before we gain the entrance of the tunnel."<br>
        <br>
        "The entrance cannot be easy?"<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir; for that reason I am accustomed to go into the steersman's<br>
        cage and myself direct our course.  And now, if you will go down, M.<br>
        Aronnax, the Nautilus is going under the waves, and will not return to<br>
        the surface until we have passed through the Arabian Tunnel."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo led me towards the central staircase; half way down he<br>
        opened a door, traversed the upper deck, and landed in the pilot's<br>
        cage, which it may be remembered rose at the extremity of the platform.<br>
        It was a cabin measuring six feet square, very much like that occupied<br>
        by the pilot on the steamboats of the Mississippi or Hudson.  In the<br>
        midst worked a wheel, placed vertically, and caught to the tiller-rope,<br>
        which ran to the back of the Nautilus.  Four light-ports with<br>
        lenticular glasses, let in a groove in the partition of the cabin,<br>
        allowed the man at the wheel to see in all directions.<br>
        <br>
        This cabin was dark; but soon my eyes accustomed themselves to the<br>
        obscurity, and I perceived the pilot, a strong man, with his hands<br>
        resting on the spokes of the wheel.  Outside, the sea appeared vividly<br>
        lit up by the lantern, which shed its rays from the back of the cabin<br>
        to the other extremity of the platform.<br>
        <br>
        "Now," said Captain Nemo, "let us try to make our passage."<br>
        <br>
        Electric wires connected the pilot's cage with the machinery room, and<br>
        from there the Captain could communicate simultaneously to his Nautilus<br>
        the direction and the speed.  He pressed a metal knob, and at once the<br>
        speed of the screw diminished.<br>
        <br>
        I looked in silence at the high straight wall we were running by at<br>
        this moment, the immovable base of a massive sandy coast.  We followed<br>
        it thus for an hour only some few yards off.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo did not take his eye from the knob, suspended by its two<br>
        concentric circles in the cabin.  At a simple gesture, the pilot<br>
        modified the course of the Nautilus every instant.<br>
        <br>
        I had placed myself at the port-scuttle, and saw some magnificent<br>
        substructures of coral, zoophytes, seaweed, and fucus, agitating their<br>
        enormous claws, which stretched out from the fissures of the rock.<br>
        <br>
        At a quarter-past ten, the Captain himself took the helm.  A large<br>
        gallery, black and deep, opened before us.  The Nautilus went boldly<br>
        into it.  A strange roaring was heard round its sides.  It was the<br>
        waters of the Red Sea, which the incline of the tunnel precipitated<br>
        violently towards the Mediterranean.  The Nautilus went with the<br>
        torrent, rapid as an arrow, in spite of the efforts of the machinery,<br>
        which, in order to offer more effective resistance, beat the waves with<br>
        reversed screw.<br>
        <br>
        On the walls of the narrow passage I could see nothing but brilliant<br>
        rays, straight lines, furrows of fire, traced by the great speed, under<br>
        the brilliant electric light.  My heart beat fast.<br>
        <br>
        At thirty-five minutes past ten, Captain Nemo quitted the helm, and,<br>
        turning to me, said:<br>
        <br>
        "The Mediterranean!"<br>
        <br>
        In less than twenty minutes, the Nautilus, carried along by the<br>
        torrent, had passed through the Isthmus of Suez.<br>
        <br>

        THE GRECIAN ARCHIPELAGO<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 12th of February, at the dawn of day, the Nautilus<br>
        rose to the surface.  I hastened on to the platform.  Three miles to<br>
        the south the dim outline of Pelusium was to be seen.  A torrent had<br>
        carried us from one sea to another.  About seven o'clock Ned and<br>
        Conseil joined me.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Sir Naturalist," said the Canadian, in a slightly jovial tone,<br>
        "and the Mediterranean?"<br>
        <br>
        "We are floating on its surface, friend Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "What!" said Conseil, "this very night."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, this very night; in a few minutes we have passed this impassable<br>
        isthmus."<br>
        <br>
        "I do not believe it," replied the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Then you are wrong, Master Land," I continued; "this low coast which<br>
        rounds off to the south is the Egyptian coast.  And you who have such<br>
        good eyes, Ned, you can see the jetty of Port Said stretching into the<br>
        sea."<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian looked attentively.<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly you are right, sir, and your Captain is a first-rate man.<br>
        We are in the Mediterranean.  Good!  Now, if you please, let us talk of<br>
        our own little affair, but so that no one hears us."<br>
        <br>
        I saw what the Canadian wanted, and, in any case, I thought it better<br>
        to let him talk, as he wished it; so we all three went and sat down<br>
        near the lantern, where we were less exposed to the spray of the blades.<br>
        <br>
        "Now, Ned, we listen; what have you to tell us?"<br>
        <br>
        "What I have to tell you is very simple.  We are in Europe; and before<br>
        Captain Nemo's caprices drag us once more to the bottom of the Polar<br>
        Seas, or lead us into Oceania, I ask to leave the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        I wished in no way to shackle the liberty of my companions, but I<br>
        certainly felt no desire to leave Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        Thanks to him, and thanks to his apparatus, I was each day nearer the<br>
        completion of my submarine studies; and I was rewriting my book of<br>
        submarine depths in its very element.  Should I ever again have such an<br>
        opportunity of observing the wonders of the ocean?  No, certainly not!<br>
        And I could not bring myself to the idea of abandoning the Nautilus<br>
        before the cycle of investigation was accomplished.<br>
        <br>
        "Friend Ned, answer me frankly, are you tired of being on board?  Are<br>
        you sorry that destiny has thrown us into Captain Nemo's hands?"<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian remained some moments without answering.  Then, crossing<br>
        his arms, he said:<br>
        <br>
        "Frankly, I do not regret this journey under the seas.  I shall be glad<br>
        to have made it; but, now that it is made, let us have done with it.<br>
        That is my idea."<br>
        <br>
        "It will come to an end, Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "Where and when?"<br>
        <br>
        "Where I do not know--when I cannot say; or, rather, I suppose it will<br>
        end when these seas have nothing more to teach us."<br>
        <br>
        "Then what do you hope for?" demanded the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "That circumstances may occur as well six months hence as now by which<br>
        we may and ought to profit."<br>
        <br>
        "Oh!" said Ned Land, "and where shall we be in six months, if you<br>
        please, Sir Naturalist?"<br>
        <br>
        "Perhaps in China; you know the Nautilus is a rapid traveller.  It goes<br>
        through water as swallows through the air, or as an express on the<br>
        land.  It does not fear frequented seas; who can say that it may not<br>
        beat the coasts of France, England, or America, on which flight may be<br>
        attempted as advantageously as here."<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax," replied the Canadian, "your arguments are rotten at the<br>
        foundation.  You speak in the future, `We shall be there!  we shall be<br>
        here!'  I speak in the present, `We are here, and we must profit by<br>
        it.'"<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land's logic pressed me hard, and I felt myself beaten on that<br>
        ground.  I knew not what argument would now tell in my favour.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," continued Ned, "let us suppose an impossibility: if Captain Nemo<br>
        should this day offer you your liberty; would you accept it?"<br>
        <br>
        "I do not know," I answered.<br>
        <br>
        "And if," he added, "the offer made you this day was never to be<br>
        renewed, would you accept it?"<br>
        <br>
        "Friend Ned, this is my answer.  Your reasoning is against me.  We must<br>
        not rely on Captain Nemo's good-will. Common prudence forbids him to<br>
        set us at liberty.  On the other side, prudence bids us profit by the<br>
        first opportunity to leave the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, M. Aronnax, that is wisely said."<br>
        <br>
        "Only one observation--just one.  The occasion must be serious, and our<br>
        first attempt must succeed; if it fails, we shall never find another,<br>
        and Captain Nemo will never forgive us."<br>
        <br>
        "All that is true," replied the Canadian.  "But your observation<br>
        applies equally to all attempts at flight, whether in two years' time,<br>
        or in two days'. But the question is still this: If a favourable<br>
        opportunity presents itself, it must be seized."<br>
        <br>
        "Agreed!  And now, Ned, will you tell me what you mean by a favourable<br>
        opportunity?"<br>
        <br>
        "It will be that which, on a dark night, will bring the Nautilus a<br>
        short distance from some European coast."<br>
        <br>
        "And you will try and save yourself by swimming?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, if we were near enough to the bank, and if the vessel was<br>
        floating at the time.  Not if the bank was far away, and the boat was<br>
        under the water."<br>
        <br>
        "And in that case?"<br>
        <br>
        "In that case, I should seek to make myself master of the pinnace.  I<br>
        know how it is worked.  We must get inside, and the bolts once drawn,<br>
        we shall come to the surface of the water, without even the pilot, who<br>
        is in the bows, perceiving our flight."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Ned, watch for the opportunity; but do not forget that a hitch<br>
        will ruin us."<br>
        <br>
        "I will not forget, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "And now, Ned, would you like to know what I think of your project?"<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly, M. Aronnax."<br>
        <a href=../site1/page1_2190.html>external_link2_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        "Well, I think--I do not say I hope--I think that this favourable<br>
        opportunity will never present itself."<br>
        <br>
        "Why not?"<br>
        <br>
        "Because Captain Nemo cannot hide from himself that we have not given<br>
        up all hope of regaining our liberty, and he will be on his guard,<br>
        above all, in the seas and in the sight of European coasts."<br>
        <br>
        "We shall see," replied Ned Land, shaking his head determinedly.<br>
        <br>
        "And now, Ned Land," I added, "let us stop here.  Not another word on<br>
        the subject.  The day that you are ready, come and let us know, and we<br>
        will follow you.  I rely entirely upon you."<br>
        <br>
        Thus ended a conversation which, at no very distant time, led to such<br>
        grave results.  I must say here that facts seemed to confirm my<br>
        foresight, to the Canadian's great despair.  Did Captain Nemo distrust<br>
        us in these frequented seas? or did he only wish to hide himself from<br>
        the numerous vessels, of all nations, which ploughed the Mediterranean?<br>
        I could not tell; but we were oftener between waters and far from the<br>
        coast.  Or, if the Nautilus did emerge, nothing was to be seen but the<br>
        pilot's cage; and sometimes it went to great depths, for, between the<br>
        Grecian Archipelago and Asia Minor we could not touch the bottom by<br>
        more than a thousand fathoms.<br>
        <br>
        Thus I only knew we were near the Island of Carpathos, one of the<br>
        Sporades, by Captain Nemo reciting these lines from Virgil:<br>
        <br>
            "Est Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates,<br>
             Caeruleus Proteus,"<br>
        <br>
        as he pointed to a spot on the planisphere.<br>
        <br>
        It was indeed the ancient abode of Proteus, the old shepherd of<br>
        Neptune's flocks, now the Island of Scarpanto, situated between Rhodes<br>
        and Crete.  I saw nothing but the granite base through the glass panels<br>
        of the saloon.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 14th of February, I resolved to employ some hours in<br>
        studying the fishes of the Archipelago; but for some reason or other<br>
        the panels remained hermetically sealed.  Upon taking the course of the<br>
        Nautilus, I found that we were going towards Candia, the ancient Isle<br>
        of Crete.  At the time I embarked on the Abraham Lincoln, the whole of<br>
        this island had risen in insurrection against the despotism of the<br>
        Turks.  But how the insurgents had fared since that time I was<br>
        absolutely ignorant, and it was not Captain Nemo, deprived of all land<br>
        communications, who could tell me.<br>
        <br>
        I made no allusion to this event when that night I found myself alone<br>
        with him in the saloon.  Besides, he seemed to be taciturn and<br>
        preoccupied.  Then, contrary to his custom, he ordered both panels to<br>
        be opened, and, going from one to the other, observed the mass of<br>
        waters attentively.  To what end I could not guess; so, on my side, I<br>
        employed my time in studying the fish passing before my eyes.<br>
        <br>
        In the midst of the waters a man appeared, a diver, carrying at his<br>
        belt a leathern purse.  It was not a body abandoned to the waves; it<br>
        was a living man, swimming with a strong hand, disappearing<br>
        occasionally to take breath at the surface.<br>
        <br>
        I turned towards Captain Nemo, and in an agitated voice exclaimed:<br>
        <br>
        "A man shipwrecked!  He must be saved at any price!"<br>
        <br>
        The Captain did not answer me, but came and leaned against the panel.<br>
        <br>
        The man had approached, and, with his face flattened against the glass,<br>
        was looking at us.<br>
        <br>
        To my great amazement, Captain Nemo signed to him.  The diver answered<br>
        with his hand, mounted immediately to the surface of the water, and did<br>
        not appear again.<br>
        <br>
        "Do not be uncomfortable," said Captain Nemo.  "It is Nicholas of Cape<br>
        Matapan, surnamed Pesca.  He is well known in all the Cyclades.  A bold<br>
        diver! water is his element, and he lives more in it than on land,<br>
        going continually from one island to another, even as far as Crete."<br>
        <br>
        "You know him, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "Why not, M. Aronnax?"<br>
        <br>
        Saying which, Captain Nemo went towards a piece of furniture standing<br>
        near the left panel of the saloon.  Near this piece of furniture, I saw<br>
        a chest bound with iron, on the cover of which was a copper plate,<br>
        bearing the cypher of the Nautilus with its device.<br>
        <br>
        At that moment, the Captain, without noticing my presence, opened the<br>
        piece of furniture, a sort of strong box, which held a great many<br>
        ingots.<br>
        <br>
        They were ingots of gold.  From whence came this precious metal, which<br>
        represented an enormous sum?  Where did the Captain gather this gold<br>
        from? and what was he going to do with it?<br>
        <br>
        I did not say one word.  I looked.  Captain Nemo took the ingots one by<br>
        one, and arranged them methodically in the chest, which he filled<br>
        entirely.  I estimated the contents at more than 4,000 lb. weight of<br>
        gold, that is to say, nearly L200,000.<br>
        <br>
        The chest was securely fastened, and the Captain wrote an address on<br>
        the lid, in characters which must have belonged to Modern Greece.<br>
        <br>
        This done, Captain Nemo pressed a knob, the wire of which communicated<br>
        with the quarters of the crew.  Four men appeared, and, not without<br>
        some trouble, pushed the chest out of the saloon.  Then I heard them<br>
        hoisting it up the iron staircase by means of pulleys.<br>
        <br>
        At that moment, Captain Nemo turned to me.<br>
        <br>
        "And you were saying, sir?" said he.<br>
        <br>
        "I was saying nothing, Captain."<br>
        <br>
        "Then, sir, if you will allow me, I will wish you good night."<br>
        <br>
        Whereupon he turned and left the saloon.<br>
        <br>
        I returned to my room much troubled, as one may believe.  I vainly<br>
        tried to sleep--I sought the connecting link between the apparition of<br>
        the diver and the chest filled with gold.  Soon, I felt by certain<br>
        movements of pitching and tossing that the Nautilus was leaving the<br>
        depths and returning to the surface.<br>
        <br>
        Then I heard steps upon the platform; and I knew they were unfastening<br>
        the pinnace and launching it upon the waves.  For one instant it struck<br>
        the side of the Nautilus, then all noise ceased.<br>
        <br>
        Two hours after, the same noise, the same going and coming was renewed;<br>
        the boat was hoisted on board, replaced in its socket, and the Nautilus<br>
        again plunged under the waves.<br>
        <br>
        So these millions had been transported to their address.  To what point<br>
        of the continent?  Who was Captain Nemo's correspondent?<br>
        <br>
        The next day I related to Conseil and the Canadian the events of the<br>
        night, which had excited my curiosity to the highest degree.  My<br>
        companions were not less surprised than myself.<br>
        <br>
        "But where does he take his millions to?" asked Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        To that there was no possible answer.  I returned to the saloon after<br>
        having breakfast and set to work.  Till five o'clock in the evening I<br>
        employed myself in arranging my notes.  At that moment--(ought I to<br>
        attribute it to some peculiar idiosyncrasy)--I felt so great a heat<br>
        that I was obliged to take off my coat.  It was strange, for we were<br>
        under low latitudes; and even then the Nautilus, submerged as it was,<br>
        ought to experience no change of temperature.  I looked at the<br>
        manometer; it showed a depth of sixty feet, to which atmospheric heat<br>
        could never attain.<br>
        <br>
        I continued my work, but the temperature rose to such a pitch as to be<br>
        intolerable.<br>
        <br>
        "Could there be fire on board?"  I asked myself.<br>
        <br>
        I was leaving the saloon, when Captain Nemo entered; he approached the<br>
        thermometer, consulted it, and, turning to me, said:<br>
        <br>
        "Forty-two degrees."<br>
        <br>
        "I have noticed it, Captain," I replied; "and if it gets much hotter we<br>
        cannot bear it."<br>
        <br>
        "Oh, sir, it will not get better if we do not wish it."<br>
        <br>
        "You can reduce it as you please, then?"<br>
        <br>
        "No; but I can go farther from the stove which produces it."<br>
        <br>
        "It is outward, then!"<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly; we are floating in a current of boiling water."<br>
        <br>
        "Is it possible!"  I exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        "Look."<br>
        <br>
        The panels opened, and I saw the sea entirely white all round.  A<br>
        sulphurous smoke was curling amid the waves, which boiled like water in<br>
        a copper.  I placed my hand on one of the panes of glass, but the heat<br>
        was so great that I quickly took it off again.<br>
        <br>
        "Where are we?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Near the Island of Santorin, sir," replied the Captain.  "I wished to<br>
        give you a sight of the curious spectacle of a submarine eruption."<br>
        <br>
        "I thought," said I, "that the formation of these new islands was<br>
        ended."<br>
        <br>
        "Nothing is ever ended in the volcanic parts of the sea," replied<br>
        Captain Nemo; "and the globe is always being worked by subterranean<br>
        fires.  Already, in the nineteenth year of our era, according to<br>
        Cassiodorus and Pliny, a new island, Theia (the divine), appeared in<br>
        the very place where these islets have recently been formed.  Then they<br>
        sank under the waves, to rise again in the year 69, when they again<br>
        subsided.  Since that time to our days the Plutonian work has been<br>
        suspended.  But on the 3rd of February, 1866, a new island, which they<br>
        named George Island, emerged from the midst of the sulphurous vapour<br>
        near Nea Kamenni, and settled again the 6th of the same month.  Seven<br>
        days after, the 13th of February, the Island of Aphroessa appeared,<br>
        leaving between Nea Kamenni and itself a canal ten yards broad.  I was<br>
        in these seas when the phenomenon occurred, and I was able therefore to<br>
        observe all the different phases.  The Island of Aphroessa, of round<br>
        form, measured 300 feet in diameter, and 30 feet in height.  It was<br>
        composed of black and vitreous lava, mixed with fragments of felspar.<br>
        And lastly, on the 10th of March, a smaller island, called Reka, showed<br>
        itself near Nea Kamenni, and since then these three have joined<br>
        together, forming but one and the same island."<br>
        <br>
        "And the canal in which we are at this moment?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Here it is," replied Captain Nemo, showing me a map of the<br>
        Archipelago.  "You see, I have marked the new islands."<br>
        <br>
        I returned to the glass.  The Nautilus was no longer moving, the heat<br>
        was becoming unbearable.  The sea, which till now had been white, was<br>
        red, owing to the presence of salts of iron.  In spite of the ship's<br>
        being hermetically sealed, an insupportable smell of sulphur filled the<br>
        saloon, and the brilliancy of the electricity was entirely extinguished<br>
        by bright scarlet flames.  I was in a bath, I was choking, I was<br>
        broiled.<br>
        <br>
        "We can remain no longer in this boiling water," said I to the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        "It would not be prudent," replied the impassive Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        An order was given; the Nautilus tacked about and left the furnace it<br>
        could not brave with impunity.  A quarter of an hour after we were<br>
        breathing fresh air on the surface.  The thought then struck me that,<br>
        if Ned Land had chosen this part of the sea for our flight, we should<br>
        never have come alive out of this sea of fire.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 16th of February, we left the basin which, between<br>
        Rhodes and Alexandria, is reckoned about 1,500 fathoms in depth, and<br>
        the Nautilus, passing some distance from Cerigo, quitted the Grecian<br>
        Archipelago after having doubled Cape Matapan.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER VII<br>
        <br>
        THE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS<br>
        <br>
        The Mediterranean, the blue sea par excellence, "the great sea" of the<br>
        Hebrews, "the sea" of the Greeks, the "mare nostrum" of the Romans,<br>
        bordered by orange-trees, aloes, cacti, and sea-pines; embalmed with<br>
        the perfume of the myrtle, surrounded by rude mountains, saturated with<br>
        pure and transparent air, but incessantly worked by underground fires;<br>
        a perfect battlefield in which Neptune and Pluto still dispute the<br>
        empire of the world!<br>
        <br>
        It is upon these banks, and on these waters, says Michelet, that man is<br>
        renewed in one of the most powerful climates of the globe.  But,<br>
        beautiful as it was, I could only take a rapid glance at the basin<br>
        whose superficial area is two million of square yards.  Even Captain<br>
        Nemo's knowledge was lost to me, for this puzzling person did not<br>
        appear once during our passage at full speed.  I estimated the course<br>
        which the Nautilus took under the waves of the sea at about six hundred<br>
        leagues, and it was accomplished in forty-eight hours.  Starting on the<br>
        morning of the 16th of February from the shores of Greece, we had<br>
        crossed the Straits of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th.<br>
        <br>
        It was plain to me that this Mediterranean, enclosed in the midst of<br>
        those countries which he wished to avoid, was distasteful to Captain<br>
        Nemo.  Those waves and those breezes brought back too many<br>
        remembrances, if not too many regrets.  Here he had no longer that<br>
        independence and that liberty of gait which he had when in the open<br>
        seas, and his Nautilus felt itself cramped between the close shores of<br>
        Africa and Europe.<br>
        <br>
        Our speed was now twenty-five miles an hour.  It may be well understood<br>
        that Ned Land, to his great disgust, was obliged to renounce his<br>
        intended flight.  He could not launch the pinnace, going at the rate of<br>
        twelve or thirteen yards every second.  To quit the Nautilus under such<br>
        conditions would be as bad as jumping from a train going at full<br>
        speed--an imprudent thing, to say the least of it.  Besides, our vessel<br>
        only mounted to the surface of the waves at night to renew its stock of<br>
        air; it was steered entirely by the compass and the log.<br>
        <br>
        I saw no more of the interior of this Mediterranean than a traveller by<br>
        express train perceives of the landscape which flies before his eyes;<br>
        that is to say, the distant horizon, and not the nearer objects which<br>
        pass like a flash of lightning.<br>
        <br>
        We were then passing between Sicily and the coast of Tunis.  In the<br>
        narrow space between Cape Bon and the Straits of Messina the bottom of<br>
        the sea rose almost suddenly.  There was a perfect bank, on which there<br>
        was not more than nine fathoms of water, whilst on either side the<br>
        depth was ninety fathoms.<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site3/page3_5292.html>external_link3_text</a><br><br>
        The Nautilus had to manoeuvre very carefully so as not to strike<br>
        against this submarine barrier.<br>
        <br>
        I showed Conseil, on the map of the Mediterranean, the spot occupied by<br>
        this reef.<br>
        <br>
        "But if you please, sir," observed Conseil, "it is like a real isthmus<br>
        joining Europe to Africa."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, my boy, it forms a perfect bar to the Straits of Lybia, and the<br>
        soundings of Smith have proved that in former times the continents<br>
        between Cape Boco and Cape Furina were joined."<br>
        <br>
        "I can well believe it," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "I will add," I continued, "that a similar barrier exists between<br>
        Gibraltar and Ceuta, which in geological times formed the entire<br>
        Mediterranean."<br>
        <br>
        "What if some volcanic burst should one day raise these two barriers<br>
        above the waves?"<br>
        <br>
        "It is not probable, Conseil."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, but allow me to finish, please, sir; if this phenomenon should<br>
        take place, it will be troublesome for M. Lesseps, who has taken so<br>
        much pains to pierce the isthmus."<br>
        <br>
        "I agree with you; but I repeat, Conseil, this phenomenon will never<br>
        happen.  The violence of subterranean force is ever diminishing.<br>
        Volcanoes, so plentiful in the first days of the world, are being<br>
        extinguished by degrees; the internal heat is weakened, the temperature<br>
        of the lower strata of the globe is lowered by a perceptible quantity<br>
        every century to the detriment of our globe, for its heat is its life."<br>
        <br>
        "But the sun?"<br>
        <br>
        "The sun is not sufficient, Conseil.  Can it give heat to a dead body?"<br>
        <br>
        "Not that I know of."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, my friend, this earth will one day be that cold corpse; it will<br>
        become uninhabitable and uninhabited like the moon, which has long<br>
        since lost all its vital heat."<br>
        <br>
        "In how many centuries?"<br>
        <br>
        "In some hundreds of thousands of years, my boy."<br>
        <br>
        "Then," said Conseil, "we shall have time to finish our journey--that<br>
        is, if Ned Land does not interfere with it."<br>
        <br>
        And Conseil, reassured, returned to the study of the bank, which the<br>
        Nautilus was skirting at a moderate speed.<br>
        <br>
        During the night of the 16th and 17th February we had entered the<br>
        second Mediterranean basin, the greatest depth of which was 1,450<br>
        fathoms.  The Nautilus, by the action of its crew, slid down the<br>
        inclined planes and buried itself in the lowest depths of the sea.<br>
        <br>
        On the 18th of February, about three o'clock in the morning, we were at<br>
        the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar.  There once existed two<br>
        currents: an upper one, long since recognised, which conveys the waters<br>
        of the ocean into the basin of the Mediterranean; and a lower<br>
        counter-current, which reasoning has now shown to exist.  Indeed, the<br>
        volume of water in the Mediterranean, incessantly added to by the waves<br>
        of the Atlantic and by rivers falling into it, would each year raise<br>
        the level of this sea, for its evaporation is not sufficient to restore<br>
        the equilibrium.  As it is not so, we must necessarily admit the<br>
        existence of an under-current, which empties into the basin of the<br>
        Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar the surplus waters of the<br>
        Mediterranean.  A fact indeed; and it was this counter-current by which<br>
        the Nautilus profited.  It advanced rapidly by the narrow pass.  For<br>
        one instant I caught a glimpse of the beautiful ruins of the temple of<br>
        Hercules, buried in the ground, according to Pliny, and with the low<br>
        island which supports it; and a few minutes later we were floating on<br>
        the Atlantic.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER VIII<br>
        <br>
        VIGO BAY<br>
        <br>
        The Atlantic! a vast sheet of water whose superficial area covers<br>
        twenty-five millions of square miles, the length of which is nine<br>
        thousand miles, with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundred--an<br>
        ocean whose parallel winding shores embrace an immense circumference,<br>
        watered by the largest rivers of the world, the St. Lawrence, the<br>
        Mississippi, the Amazon, the Plata, the Orinoco, the Niger, the<br>
        Senegal, the Elbe, the Loire, and the Rhine, which carry water from the<br>
        most civilised, as well as from the most savage, countries!<br>
        Magnificent field of water, incessantly ploughed by vessels of every<br>
        nation, sheltered by the flags of every nation, and which terminates in<br>
        those two terrible points so dreaded by mariners, Cape Horn and the<br>
        Cape of Tempests.<br>
        <br>
        The Nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having<br>
        accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a<br>
        distance greater than the great circle of the earth.  Where were we<br>
        going now, and what was reserved for the future?  The Nautilus, leaving<br>
        the Straits of Gibraltar, had gone far out.  It returned to the surface<br>
        of the waves, and our daily walks on the platform were restored to us.<br>
        <br>
        I mounted at once, accompanied by Ned Land and Conseil.  At a distance<br>
        of about twelve miles, Cape St. Vincent was dimly to be seen, forming<br>
        the south-western point of the Spanish peninsula.  A strong southerly<br>
        gale was blowing.  The sea was swollen and billowy; it made the<br>
        Nautilus rock violently.  It was almost impossible to keep one's foot<br>
        on the platform, which the heavy rolls of the sea beat over every<br>
        instant.  So we descended after inhaling some mouthfuls of fresh air.<br>
        <br>
        I returned to my room, Conseil to his cabin; but the Canadian, with a<br>
        preoccupied air, followed me.  Our rapid passage across the<br>
        Mediterranean had not allowed him to put his project into execution,<br>
        and he could not help showing his disappointment.  When the door of my<br>
        room was shut, he sat down and looked at me silently.<br>
        <br>
        "Friend Ned," said I, "I understand you; but you cannot reproach<br>
        yourself.  To have attempted to leave the Nautilus under the<br>
        circumstances would have been folly."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land did not answer; his compressed lips and frowning brow showed<br>
        with him the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of his mind.<br>
        <br>
        "Let us see," I continued; "we need not despair yet.  We are going up<br>
        the coast of Portugal again; France and England are not far off, where<br>
        we can easily find refuge.  Now if the Nautilus, on leaving the Straits<br>
        of Gibraltar, had gone to the south, if it had carried us towards<br>
        regions where there were no continents, I should share your uneasiness.<br>
        But we know now that Captain Nemo does not fly from civilised seas, and<br>
        in some days I think you can act with security."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land still looked at me fixedly; at length his fixed lips parted,<br>
        and he said, "It is for to-night."<br>
        <br>
        I drew myself up suddenly.  I was, I admit, little prepared for this<br>
        communication.  I wanted to answer the Canadian, but words would not<br>
        come.<br>
        <br>
        "We agreed to wait for an opportunity," continued Ned Land, "and the<br>
        opportunity has arrived.  This night we shall be but a few miles from<br>
        the Spanish coast.  It is cloudy.  The wind blows freely.  I have your<br>
        word, M. Aronnax, and I rely upon you."<br>
        <br>
        As I was silent, the Canadian approached me.<br>
        <br>
        "To-night, at nine o'clock," said he.  "I have warned Conseil.  At that<br>
        moment Captain Nemo will be shut up in his room, probably in bed.<br>
        Neither the engineers nor the ship's crew can see us.  Conseil and I<br>
        will gain the central staircase, and you, M. Aronnax, will remain in<br>
        the library, two steps from us, waiting my signal.  The oars, the mast,<br>
        and the sail are in the canoe.  I have even succeeded in getting some<br>
        provisions.  I have procured an English wrench, to unfasten the bolts<br>
        which attach it to the shell of the Nautilus.  So all is ready, till<br>
        to-night."<br>
        <br>
        "The sea is bad."<br>
        <br>
        "That I allow," replied the Canadian; "but we must risk that.  Liberty<br>
        is worth paying for; besides, the boat is strong, and a few miles with<br>
        a fair wind to carry us is no great thing.  Who knows but by to-morrow<br>
        we may be a hundred leagues away?  Let circumstances only favour us,<br>
        and by ten or eleven o'clock we shall have landed on some spot of terra<br>
        firma, alive or dead.  But adieu now till to-night."<br>
        <br>
        With these words the Canadian withdrew, leaving me almost dumb.  I had<br>
        imagined that, the chance gone, I should have time to reflect and<br>
        discuss the matter.  My obstinate companion had given me no time; and,<br>
        after all, what could I have said to him?  Ned Land was perfectly<br>
        right.  There was almost the opportunity to profit by.  Could I retract<br>
        my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the<br>
        future of my companions?  To-morrow Captain Nemo might take us far from<br>
        all land.<br>
        <br>
        At that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs<br>
        were filling, and that the Nautilus was sinking under the waves of the<br>
        Atlantic.<br>
        <br>
        A sad day I passed, between the desire of regaining my liberty of<br>
        action and of abandoning the wonderful Nautilus, and leaving my<br>
        submarine studies incomplete.<br>
        <br>
        What dreadful hours I passed thus!  Sometimes seeing myself and<br>
        companions safely landed, sometimes wishing, in spite of my reason,<br>
        that some unforeseen circumstance, would prevent the realisation of Ned<br>
        Land's project.<br>
        <br>
        Twice I went to the saloon.  I wished to consult the compass.  I wished<br>
        to see if the direction the Nautilus was taking was bringing us nearer<br>
        or taking us farther from the coast.  But no; the Nautilus kept in<br>
        Portuguese waters.<br>
        <br>
        I must therefore take my part and prepare for flight.  My luggage was<br>
        not heavy; my notes, nothing more.<br>
        <br>
        As to Captain Nemo, I asked myself what he would think of our escape;<br>
        what trouble, what wrong it might cause him and what he might do in<br>
        case of its discovery or failure.  Certainly I had no cause to complain<br>
        of him; on the contrary, never was hospitality freer than his.  In<br>
        leaving him I could not be taxed with ingratitude.  No oath bound us to<br>
        him.  It was on the strength of circumstances he relied, and not upon<br>
        our word, to fix us for ever.<br>
        <br>
        I had not seen the Captain since our visit to the Island of Santorin.<br>
        Would chance bring me to his presence before our departure?  I wished<br>
        it, and I feared it at the same time.  I listened if I could hear him<br>
        walking the room contiguous to mine.  No sound reached my ear.  I felt<br>
        an unbearable uneasiness.  This day of waiting seemed eternal.  Hours<br>
        struck too slowly to keep pace with my impatience.<br>
        <br>
        My dinner was served in my room as usual.  I ate but little; I was too<br>
        preoccupied.  I left the table at seven o'clock. A hundred and twenty<br>
        minutes (I counted them) still separated me from the moment in which I<br>
        was to join Ned Land.  My agitation redoubled.  My pulse beat<br>
        violently.  I could not remain quiet.  I went and came, hoping to calm<br>
        my troubled spirit by constant movement.  The idea of failure in our<br>
        bold enterprise was the least painful of my anxieties; but the thought<br>
        of seeing our project discovered before leaving the Nautilus, of being<br>
        brought before Captain Nemo, irritated, or (what was worse) saddened,<br>
        at my desertion, made my heart beat.<br>
        <br>
        I wanted to see the saloon for the last time.  I descended the stairs<br>
        and arrived in the museum, where I had passed so many useful and<br>
        agreeable hours.  I looked at all its riches, all its treasures, like a<br>
        man on the eve of an eternal exile, who was leaving never to return.<br>
        <br>
        These wonders of Nature, these masterpieces of art, amongst which for<br>
        so many days my life had been concentrated, I was going to abandon them<br>
        for ever!  I should like to have taken a last look through the windows<br>
        of the saloon into the waters of the Atlantic:  but the panels were<br>
        hermetically closed, and a cloak of steel separated me from that ocean<br>
        which I had not yet explored.<br>
        <br>
        In passing through the saloon, I came near the door let into the angle<br>
        which opened into the Captain's room.  To my great surprise, this door<br>
        was ajar.  I drew back involuntarily.  If Captain Nemo should be in his<br>
        room, he could see me.  But, hearing no sound, I drew nearer.  The room<br>
        was deserted.  I pushed open the door and took some steps forward.<br>
        Still the same monklike severity of aspect.<br>
        <br>
        Suddenly the clock struck eight.  The first beat of the hammer on the<br>
        bell awoke me from my dreams.  I trembled as if an invisible eye had<br>
        plunged into my most secret thoughts, and I hurried from the room.<br>
        <br>
        There my eye fell upon the compass.  Our course was still north.  The<br>
        log indicated moderate speed, the manometer a depth of about sixty feet.<br>
        <br>
        I returned to my room, clothed myself warmly--sea boots, an otterskin<br>
        cap, a great coat of byssus, lined with sealskin; I was ready, I was<br>
        waiting.  The vibration of the screw alone broke the deep silence which<br>
        reigned on board.  I listened attentively.  Would no loud voice<br>
        suddenly inform me that Ned Land had been surprised in his projected<br>
        flight.  A mortal dread hung over me, and I vainly tried to regain my<br>
        accustomed coolness.<br>
        <br>
        At a few minutes to nine, I put my ear to the Captain's door.  No<br>
        noise.  I left my room and returned to the saloon, which was half in<br>
        obscurity, but deserted.<br>
        <br>
        I opened the door communicating with the library.  The same<br>
        insufficient light, the same solitude.  I placed myself near the door<br>
        leading to the central staircase, and there waited for Ned Land's<br>
        signal.<br>
        <br>
        At that moment the trembling of the screw sensibly diminished, then it<br>
        stopped entirely.  The silence was now only disturbed by the beatings<br>
        of my own heart.  Suddenly a slight shock was felt; and I knew that the<br>
        Nautilus had stopped at the bottom of the ocean.  My uneasiness<br>
        increased.  The Canadian's signal did not come.  I felt inclined to<br>
        join Ned Land and beg of him to put off his attempt.  I felt that we<br>
        were not sailing under our usual conditions.<br>
        <br>
        At this moment the door of the large saloon opened, and Captain Nemo<br>
        appeared.  He saw me, and without further preamble began in an amiable<br>
        tone of voice:<br>
        <br>
        "Ah, sir!  I have been looking for you.  Do you know the history of<br>
        Spain?"<br>
        <br>
        Now, one might know the history of one's own country by heart; but in<br>
        the condition I was at the time, with troubled mind and head quite<br>
        lost, I could not have said a word of it.<br>
        <br>
        "Well," continued Captain Nemo, "you heard my question!  Do you know<br>
        the history of Spain?"<br>
        <br>
        "Very slightly," I answered.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, here are learned men having to learn," said the Captain.  "Come,<br>
        sit down, and I will tell you a curious episode in this history.  Sir,<br>
        listen well," said he; "this history will interest you on one side, for<br>
        it will answer a question which doubtless you have not been able to<br>
        solve."<br>
        <a href=../site4/page4_2164.html>internal_link4_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        "I listen, Captain," said I, not knowing what my interlocutor was<br>
        driving at, and asking myself if this incident was bearing on our<br>
        projected flight.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir, if you have no objection, we will go back to 1702.  You cannot be<br>
        ignorant that your king, Louis XIV, thinking that the gesture of a<br>
        potentate was sufficient to bring the Pyrenees under his yoke, had<br>
        imposed the Duke of Anjou, his grandson, on the Spaniards.  This prince<br>
        reigned more or less badly under the name of Philip V, and had a strong<br>
        party against him abroad.  Indeed, the preceding year, the royal houses<br>
        of Holland, Austria, and England had concluded a treaty of alliance at<br>
        the Hague, with the intention of plucking the crown of Spain from the<br>
        head of Philip V, and placing it on that of an archduke to whom they<br>
        prematurely gave the title of Charles III.<br>
        <br>
        "Spain must resist this coalition; but she was almost entirely<br>
        unprovided with either soldiers or sailors.  However, money would not<br>
        fail them, provided that their galleons, laden with gold and silver<br>
        from America, once entered their ports.  And about the end of 1702 they<br>
        expected a rich convoy which France was escorting with a fleet of<br>
        twenty-three vessels, commanded by Admiral Chateau-Renaud, for the<br>
        ships of the coalition were already beating the Atlantic.  This convoy<br>
        was to go to Cadiz, but the Admiral, hearing that an English fleet was<br>
        cruising in those waters, resolved to make for a French port.<br>
        <br>
        "The Spanish commanders of the convoy objected to this decision.  They<br>
        wanted to be taken to a Spanish port, and, if not to Cadiz, into Vigo<br>
        Bay, situated on the northwest coast of Spain, and which was not<br>
        blocked.<br>
        <br>
        "Admiral Chateau-Renaud had the rashness to obey this injunction, and<br>
        the galleons entered Vigo Bay.<br>
        <br>
        "Unfortunately, it formed an open road which could not be defended in<br>
        any way.  They must therefore hasten to unload the galleons before the<br>
        arrival of the combined fleet; and time would not have failed them had<br>
        not a miserable question of rivalry suddenly arisen.<br>
        <br>
        "You are following the chain of events?" asked Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "Perfectly," said I, not knowing the end proposed by this historical<br>
        lesson.<br>
        <br>
        "I will continue.  This is what passed.  The merchants of Cadiz had a<br>
        privilege by which they had the right of receiving all merchandise<br>
        coming from the West Indies.  Now, to disembark these ingots at the<br>
        port of Vigo was depriving them of their rights.  They complained at<br>
        Madrid, and obtained the consent of the weak-minded Philip that the<br>
        convoy, without discharging its cargo, should remain sequestered in the<br>
        roads of Vigo until the enemy had disappeared.<br>
        <br>
        "But whilst coming to this decision, on the 22nd of October, 1702, the<br>
        English vessels arrived in Vigo Bay, when Admiral Chateau-Renaud, in<br>
        spite of inferior forces, fought bravely.  But, seeing that the<br>
        treasure must fall into the enemy's hands, he burnt and scuttled every<br>
        galleon, which went to the bottom with their immense riches."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo stopped.  I admit I could not see yet why this history<br>
        should interest me.<br>
        <br>
        "Well?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo, "we are in that Vigo Bay; and<br>
        it rests with yourself whether you will penetrate its mysteries."<br>
        <br>
        The Captain rose, telling me to follow him.  I had had time to recover.<br>
        I obeyed.  The saloon was dark, but through the transparent glass the<br>
        waves were sparkling.  I looked.<br>
        <br>
        For half a mile around the Nautilus, the waters seemed bathed in<br>
        electric light.  The sandy bottom was clean and bright.  Some of the<br>
        ship's crew in their diving-dresses were clearing away half-rotten<br>
        barrels and empty cases from the midst of the blackened wrecks.  From<br>
        these cases and from these barrels escaped ingots of gold and silver,<br>
        cascades of piastres and jewels.  The sand was heaped up with them.<br>
        Laden with their precious booty, the men returned to the Nautilus,<br>
        disposed of their burden, and went back to this inexhaustible fishery<br>
        of gold and silver.<br>
        <br>
        I understood now.  This was the scene of the battle of the 22nd of<br>
        October, 1702.  Here on this very spot the galleons laden for the<br>
        Spanish Government had sunk.  Here Captain Nemo came, according to his<br>
        wants, to pack up those millions with which he burdened the Nautilus.<br>
        It was for him and him alone America had given up her precious metals.<br>
        He was heir direct, without anyone to share, in those treasures torn<br>
        from the Incas and from the conquered of Ferdinand Cortez.<br>
        <br>
        "Did you know, sir," he asked, smiling, "that the sea contained such<br>
        riches?"<br>
        <br>
        "I knew," I answered, "that they value money held in suspension in<br>
        these waters at two millions."<br>
        <br>
        "Doubtless; but to extract this money the expense would be greater than<br>
        the profit.  Here, on the contrary, I have but to pick up what man has<br>
        lost--and not only in Vigo Bay, but in a thousand other ports where<br>
        shipwrecks have happened, and which are marked on my submarine map.<br>
        Can you understand now the source of the millions I am worth?"<br>
        <br>
        "I understand, Captain.  But allow me to tell you that in exploring<br>
        Vigo Bay you have only been beforehand with a rival society."<br>
        <br>
        "And which?"<br>
        <br>
        "A society which has received from the Spanish Government the privilege<br>
        of seeking those buried galleons.  The shareholders are led on by the<br>
        allurement of an enormous bounty, for they value these rich shipwrecks<br>
        at five hundred millions."<br>
        <br>
        "Five hundred millions they were," answered Captain Nemo, "but they are<br>
        so no longer."<br>
        <br>
        "Just so," said I; "and a warning to those shareholders would be an act<br>
        of charity.  But who knows if it would be well received?  What gamblers<br>
        usually regret above all is less the loss of their money than of their<br>
        foolish hopes.  After all, I pity them less than the thousands of<br>
        unfortunates to whom so much riches well-distributed would have been<br>
        profitable, whilst for them they will be for ever barren."<br>
        <br>
        I had no sooner expressed this regret than I felt that it must have<br>
        wounded Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "Barren!" he exclaimed, with animation.  "Do you think then, sir, that<br>
        these riches are lost because I gather them?  Is it for myself alone,<br>
        according to your idea, that I take the trouble to collect these<br>
        treasures?  Who told you that I did not make a good use of it?  Do you<br>
        think I am ignorant that there are suffering beings and oppressed races<br>
        on this earth, miserable creatures to console, victims to avenge?  Do<br>
        you not understand?"<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo stopped at these last words, regretting perhaps that he<br>
        had spoken so much.  But I had guessed that, whatever the motive which<br>
        had forced him to seek independence under the sea, it had left him<br>
        still a man, that his heart still beat for the sufferings of humanity,<br>
        and that his immense charity was for oppressed races as well as<br>
        individuals.  And I then understood for whom those millions were<br>
        destined which were forwarded by Captain Nemo when the Nautilus was<br>
        cruising in the waters of Crete.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER IX<br>
        <br>
        A VANISHED CONTINENT<br>
        <br>
        The next morning, the 19th of February, I saw the Canadian enter my<br>
        room.  I expected this visit.  He looked very disappointed.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, sir?" said he.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Ned, fortune was against us yesterday."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes; that Captain must needs stop exactly at the hour we intended<br>
        leaving his vessel."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Ned, he had business at his bankers."<br>
        <br>
        "His bankers!"<br>
        <br>
        "Or rather his banking-house; by that I mean the ocean, where his<br>
        riches are safer than in the chests of the State."<br>
        <br>
        I then related to the Canadian the incidents of the preceding night,<br>
        hoping to bring him back to the idea of not abandoning the Captain; but<br>
        my recital had no other result than an energetically expressed regret<br>
        from Ned that he had not been able to take a walk on the battlefield of<br>
        Vigo on his own account.<br>
        <br>
        "However," said he, "all is not ended.  It is only a blow of the<br>
        harpoon lost.  Another time we must succeed; and to-night, if<br>
        necessary----"<br>
        <br>
        "In what direction is the Nautilus going?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "I do not know," replied Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, at noon we shall see the point."<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian returned to Conseil.  As soon as I was dressed, I went<br>
        into the saloon.  The compass was not reassuring.  The course of the<br>
        Nautilus was S.S.W. We were turning our backs on Europe.<br>
        <br>
        I waited with some impatience till the ship's place was pricked on the<br>
        chart.  At about half-past eleven the reservoirs were emptied, and our<br>
        vessel rose to the surface of the ocean.  I rushed towards the<br>
        platform.  Ned Land had preceded me.  No more land in sight.  Nothing<br>
        but an immense sea.  Some sails on the horizon, doubtless those going<br>
        to San Roque in search of favourable winds for doubling the Cape of<br>
        Good Hope.  The weather was cloudy.  A gale of wind was preparing.  Ned<br>
        raved, and tried to pierce the cloudy horizon.  He still hoped that<br>
        behind all that fog stretched the land he so longed for.<br>
        <br>
        At noon the sun showed itself for an instant.  The second profited by<br>
        this brightness to take its height.  Then, the sea becoming more<br>
        billowy, we descended, and the panel closed.<br>
        <br>
        An hour after, upon consulting the chart, I saw the position of the<br>
        Nautilus was marked at 16° 17' long., and 33° 22' lat., at 150<br>
        leagues from the nearest coast.  There was no means of flight, and I<br>
        leave you to imagine the rage of the Canadian when I informed him of<br>
        our situation.<br>
        <br>
        For myself, I was not particularly sorry.  I felt lightened of the load<br>
        which had oppressed me, and was able to return with some degree of<br>
        calmness to my accustomed work.<br>
        <br>
        That night, about eleven o'clock, I received a most unexpected visit<br>
        from Captain Nemo.  He asked me very graciously if I felt fatigued from<br>
        my watch of the preceding night.  I answered in the negative.<br>
        <br>
        "Then, M. Aronnax, I propose a curious excursion."<br>
        <br>
        "Propose, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "You have hitherto only visited the submarine depths by daylight, under<br>
        the brightness of the sun.  Would it suit you to see them in the<br>
        darkness of the night?"<br>
        <br>
        "Most willingly."<br>
        <br>
        "I warn you, the way will be tiring.  We shall have far to walk, and<br>
        must climb a mountain.  The roads are not well kept."<br>
        <br>
        "What you say, Captain, only heightens my curiosity; I am ready to<br>
        follow you."<br>
        <br>
        "Come then, sir, we will put on our diving-dresses."<br>
        <br>
        Arrived at the robing-room, I saw that neither of my companions nor any<br>
        of the ship's crew were to follow us on this excursion.  Captain Nemo<br>
        had not even proposed my taking with me either Ned or Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        In a few moments we had put on our diving-dresses; they placed on our<br>
        backs the reservoirs, abundantly filled with air, but no electric lamps<br>
        were prepared.  I called the Captain's attention to the fact.<br>
        <br>
        "They will be useless," he replied.<br>
        <br>
        I thought I had not heard aright, but I could not repeat my<br>
        observation, for the Captain's head had already disappeared in its<br>
        metal case.  I finished harnessing myself.  I felt them put an<br>
        iron-pointed stick into my hand, and some minutes later, after going<br>
        through the usual form, we set foot on the bottom of the Atlantic at a<br>
        depth of 150 fathoms.  Midnight was near.  The waters were profoundly<br>
        dark, but Captain Nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot, a<br>
        sort of large light shining brilliantly about two miles from the<br>
        Nautilus.  What this fire might be, what could feed it, why and how it<br>
        lit up the liquid mass, I could not say.  In any case, it did light our<br>
        way, vaguely, it is true, but I soon accustomed myself to the peculiar<br>
        darkness, and I understood, under such circumstances, the uselessness<br>
        of the Ruhmkorff apparatus.<br>
        <br>
        As we advanced, I heard a kind of pattering above my head.  The noise<br>
        redoubling, sometimes producing a continual shower, I soon understood<br>
        the cause.  It was rain falling violently, and crisping the surface of<br>
        the waves.  Instinctively the thought flashed across my mind that I<br>
        should be wet through!  By the water! in the midst of the water!  I<br>
        could not help laughing at the odd idea.  But, indeed, in the thick<br>
        diving-dress, the liquid element is no longer felt, and one only seems<br>
        to be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere.<br>
        Nothing more.<br>
        <br>
        After half an hour's walk the soil became stony.  Medusae, microscopic<br>
        crustacea, and pennatules lit it slightly with their phosphorescent<br>
        gleam.  I caught a glimpse of pieces of stone covered with millions of<br>
        zoophytes and masses of sea weed.  My feet often slipped upon this<br>
        sticky carpet of sea weed, and without my iron-tipped stick I should<br>
        have fallen more than once.  In turning round, I could still see the<br>
        whitish lantern of the Nautilus beginning to pale in the distance.<br>
        <br>
        But the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon.<br>
        The presence of this fire under water puzzled me in the highest degree.<br>
        Was I going towards a natural phenomenon as yet unknown to the _savants_<br>
        of the earth?  Or even (for this thought crossed my brain) had the hand<br>
        of man aught to do with this conflagration?  Had he fanned this flame?<br>
        Was I to meet in these depths companions and friends of Captain Nemo<br>
        whom he was going to visit, and who, like him, led this strange<br>
        existence?  Should I find down there a whole colony of exiles who,<br>
        weary of the miseries of this earth, had sought and found independence<br>
        in the deep ocean?  All these foolish and unreasonable ideas pursued<br>
        me.  And in this condition of mind, over-excited by the succession of<br>
        wonders continually passing before my eyes, I should not have been<br>
        surprised to meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns<br>
        of which Captain Nemo dreamed.<br>
        <br>
        Our road grew lighter and lighter.  The white glimmer came in rays from<br>
        the summit of a mountain about 800 feet high.  But what I saw was<br>
        simply a reflection, developed by the clearness of the waters.  The<br>
        source of this inexplicable light was a fire on the opposite side of<br>
        the mountain.<br>
        <br>
        In the midst of this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the Atlantic,<br>
        Captain Nemo advanced without hesitation.  He knew this dreary road.<br>
