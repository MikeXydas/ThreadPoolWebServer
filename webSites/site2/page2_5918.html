        frequents the strata lying miles below the surface of the water, it<br>
        must necessarily possess an organisation the strength of which would<br>
        defy all comparison."<br>
        <br>
        "And why this powerful organisation?" demanded Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "Because it requires incalculable strength to keep one's self in these<br>
        strata and resist their pressure.  Listen to me.  Let us admit that the<br>
        pressure of the atmosphere is represented by the weight of a column of<br>
        water thirty-two feet high.  In reality the column of water would be<br>
        shorter, as we are speaking of sea water, the density of which is<br>
        greater than that of fresh water.  Very well, when you dive, Ned, as<br>
        many times 32 feet of water as there are above you, so many times does<br>
        your body bear a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere, that is to<br>
        say, 15 lb. for each square inch of its surface.  It follows, then,<br>
        that at 320 feet this pressure equals that of 10 atmospheres, of 100<br>
        atmospheres at 3,200 feet, and of 1,000 atmospheres at 32,000 feet,<br>
        that is, about 6 miles; which is equivalent to saying that if you could<br>
        attain this depth in the ocean, each square three-eighths of an inch of<br>
        the surface of your body would bear a pressure of 5,600 lb.  Ah! my<br>
        brave Ned, do you know how many square inches you carry on the surface<br>
        of your body?"<br>
        <br>
        "I have no idea, Mr. Aronnax."<br>
        <br>
        "About 6,500; and as in reality the atmospheric pressure is about 15<br>
        lb.  to the square inch, your 6,500 square inches bear at this moment a<br>
        pressure of 97,500 lb."<br>
        <br>
        "Without my perceiving it?"<br>
        <br>
        "Without your perceiving it.  And if you are not crushed by such a<br>
        pressure, it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body<br>
        with equal pressure.  Hence perfect equilibrium between the interior<br>
        and exterior pressure, which thus neutralise each other, and which<br>
        allows you to bear it without inconvenience.  But in the water it is<br>
        another thing."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, I understand," replied Ned, becoming more attentive; "because the<br>
        water surrounds me, but does not penetrate."<br>
        <br>
        "Precisely, Ned:  so that at 32 feet beneath the surface of the sea you<br>
        would undergo a pressure of 97,500 lb.; at 320 feet, ten times that<br>
        pressure; at 3,200 feet, a hundred times that pressure; lastly, at<br>
        32,000 feet, a thousand times that pressure would be 97,500,000<br>
        lb.--that is to say, that you would be flattened as if you had been<br>
        drawn from the plates of a hydraulic machine!"<br>
        <br>
        "The devil!" exclaimed Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "Very well, my worthy harpooner, if some vertebrate, several hundred<br>
        yards long, and large in proportion, can maintain itself in such<br>
        depths--of those whose surface is represented by millions of square<br>
        inches, that is by tens of millions of pounds, we must estimate the<br>
        pressure they undergo.  Consider, then, what must be the resistance of<br>
        their bony structure, and the strength of their organisation to<br>
        withstand such pressure!"<br>
        <br>
        "Why!" exclaimed Ned Land, "they must be made of iron plates eight<br>
        inches thick, like the armoured frigates."<br>
        <br>
        "As you say, Ned.  And think what destruction such a mass would cause,<br>
        if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a<br>
        vessel."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes--certainly--perhaps," replied the Canadian, shaken by these<br>
        figures, but not yet willing to give in.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, have I convinced you?"<br>
        <br>
        "You have convinced me of one thing, sir, which is that, if such<br>
        animals do exist at the bottom of the seas, they must necessarily be as<br>
        strong as you say."<br>
        <br>
        "But if they do not exist, mine obstinate harpooner, how explain the<br>
        accident to the Scotia?"<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER V<br>
        <br>
        AT A VENTURE<br>
        <br>
        The voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was for a long time marked by no<br>
        special incident.  But one circumstance happened which showed the<br>
        wonderful dexterity of Ned Land, and proved what confidence we might<br>
        place in him.<br>
        <br>
        The 30th of June, the frigate spoke some American whalers, from whom we<br>
        learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal.  But one of them, the<br>
        captain of the Monroe, knowing that Ned Land had shipped on board the<br>
        Abraham Lincoln, begged for his help in chasing a whale they had in<br>
        sight.  Commander Farragut, desirous of seeing Ned Land at work, gave<br>
        him permission to go on board the Monroe.  And fate served our Canadian<br>
        so well that, instead of one whale, he harpooned two with a double<br>
        blow, striking one straight to the heart, and catching the other after<br>
        some minutes' pursuit.<br>
        <br>
        Decidedly, if the monster ever had to do with Ned Land's harpoon, I<br>
        would not bet in its favour.<br>
        <br>
        The frigate skirted the south-east coast of America with great<br>
        rapidity.  The 3rd of July we were at the opening of the Straits of<br>
        Magellan, level with Cape Vierges.  But Commander Farragut would not<br>
        take a tortuous passage, but doubled Cape Horn.<br>
        <br>
        The ship's crew agreed with him.  And certainly it was possible that<br>
        they might meet the narwhal in this narrow pass.  Many of the sailors<br>
        affirmed that the monster could not pass there, "that he was too big<br>
        for that!"<br>
        <br>
        The 6th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the Abraham<br>
        Lincoln, at fifteen miles to the south, doubled the solitary island,<br>
        this lost rock at the extremity of the American continent, to which<br>
        some Dutch sailors gave the name of their native town, Cape Horn.  The<br>
        course was taken towards the north-west, and the next day the screw of<br>
        the frigate was at last beating the waters of the Pacific.<br>
        <br>
        "Keep your eyes open!" called out the sailors.<br>
        <br>
        And they were opened widely.  Both eyes and glasses, a little dazzled,<br>
        it is true, by the prospect of two thousand dollars, had not an<br>
        instant's repose.<br>
        <br>
        I myself, for whom money had no charms, was not the least attentive on<br>
        board.  Giving but few minutes to my meals, but a few hours to sleep,<br>
        indifferent to either rain or sunshine, I did not leave the poop of the<br>
        vessel.  Now leaning on the netting of the forecastle, now on the<br>
        taffrail, I devoured with eagerness the soft foam which whitened the<br>
        sea as far as the eye could reach; and how often have I shared the<br>
        emotion of the majority of the crew, when some capricious whale raised<br>
        its black back above the waves!  The poop of the vessel was crowded on<br>
        a moment.  The cabins poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers,<br>
        each with heaving breast and troubled eye watching the course of the<br>
        cetacean.  I looked and looked till I was nearly blind, whilst Conseil<br>
        kept repeating in a calm voice:<br>
        <br>
        "If, sir, you would not squint so much, you would see better!"<br>
        <br>
        But vain excitement!  The Abraham Lincoln checked its speed and made<br>
        for the animal signalled, a simple whale, or common cachalot, which<br>
        soon disappeared amidst a storm of abuse.<br>
        <br>
        But the weather was good.  The voyage was being accomplished under the<br>
        most favourable auspices.  It was then the bad season in Australia, the<br>
        July of that zone corresponding to our January in Europe, but the sea<br>
        was beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference.<br>
        <br>
        The 20th of July, the tropic of Capricorn was cut by 105d of longitude,<br>
        and the 27th of the same month we crossed the Equator on the 110th<br>
        meridian.  This passed, the frigate took a more decided westerly<br>
        direction, and scoured the central waters of the Pacific.  Commander<br>
        Farragut thought, and with reason, that it was better to remain in deep<br>
        water, and keep clear of continents or islands, which the beast itself<br>
        seemed to shun (perhaps because there was not enough water for him!<br>
        suggested the greater part of the crew). The frigate passed at some<br>
        distance from the Marquesas and the Sandwich Islands, crossed the<br>
        tropic of Cancer, and made for the China Seas.  We were on the theatre<br>
        of the last diversions of the monster:  and, to say truth, we no longer<br>
        LIVED on board.  The entire ship's crew were undergoing a nervous<br>
        excitement, of which I can give no idea:  they could not eat, they<br>
        could not sleep--twenty times a day, a misconception or an optical<br>
        illusion of some sailor seated on the taffrail, would cause dreadful<br>
        perspirations, and these emotions, twenty times repeated, kept us in a<br>
        state of excitement so violent that a reaction was unavoidable.<br>
        <br>
        And truly, reaction soon showed itself.  For three months, during which<br>
        a day seemed an age, the Abraham Lincoln furrowed all the waters of the<br>
        Northern Pacific, running at whales, making sharp deviations from her<br>
        course, veering suddenly from one tack to another, stopping suddenly,<br>
        putting on steam, and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging<br>
        her machinery, and not one point of the Japanese or American coast was<br>
        left unexplored.<br>
        <br>
        The warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most ardent<br>
        detractors.  Reaction mounted from the crew to the captain himself, and<br>
        certainly, had it not been for the resolute determination on the part<br>
        of Captain Farragut, the frigate would have headed due southward.  This<br>
        useless search could not last much longer.  The Abraham Lincoln had<br>
        nothing to reproach herself with, she had done her best to succeed.<br>
        Never had an American ship's crew shown more zeal or patience; its<br>
        failure could not be placed to their charge--there remained nothing but<br>
        to return.<br>
        <br>
        This was represented to the commander.  The sailors could not hide<br>
        their discontent, and the service suffered.  I will not say there was a<br>
        mutiny on board, but after a reasonable period of obstinacy, Captain<br>
        Farragut (as Columbus did) asked for three days' patience.  If in three<br>
        days the monster did not appear, the man at the helm should give three<br>
        turns of the wheel, and the Abraham Lincoln would make for the European<br>
        seas.<br>
        <br>
        This promise was made on the 2nd of November.  It had the effect of<br>
        rallying the ship's crew.  The ocean was watched with renewed<br>
        attention.  Each one wished for a last glance in which to sum up his<br>
        remembrance.  Glasses were used with feverish activity.  It was a grand<br>
        defiance given to the giant narwhal, and he could scarcely fail to<br>
        answer the summons and "appear."<br>
        <br>
        Two days passed, the steam was at half pressure; a thousand schemes<br>
        were tried to attract the attention and stimulate the apathy of the<br>
        animal in case it should be met in those parts.  Large quantities of<br>
        bacon were trailed in the wake of the ship, to the great satisfaction<br>
        (I must say) of the sharks.  Small craft radiated in all directions<br>
        round the Abraham Lincoln as she lay to, and did not leave a spot of<br>
        the sea unexplored.  But the night of the 4th of November arrived<br>
        without the unveiling of this submarine mystery.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 5th of November, at twelve, the delay would (morally<br>
        speaking) expire; after that time, Commander Farragut, faithful to his<br>
        promise, was to turn the course to the south-east and abandon for ever<br>
        the northern regions of the Pacific.<br>
        <br>
        The frigate was then in 31° 15' N. lat. and 136° 42' E. long.<br>
        The coast of Japan still remained less than two hundred miles to<br>
        leeward.  Night was approaching.  They had just struck eight bells;<br>
        large clouds veiled the face of the moon, then in its first quarter.<br>
        The sea undulated peaceably under the stern of the vessel.<br>
        <br>
        At that moment I was leaning forward on the starboard netting.<br>
        Conseil, standing near me, was looking straight before him.  The crew,<br>
        perched in the ratlines, examined the horizon which contracted and<br>
        darkened by degrees.  Officers with their night glasses scoured the<br>
        growing darkness:  sometimes the ocean sparkled under the rays of the<br>
        moon, which darted between two clouds, then all trace of light was lost<br>
        in the darkness.<br>
        <br>
        In looking at Conseil, I could see he was undergoing a little of the<br>
        general influence.  At least I thought so.  Perhaps for the first time<br>
        his nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity.<br>
        <br>
        "Come, Conseil," said I, "this is the last chance of pocketing the two<br>
        thousand dollars."<br>
        <br>
        "May I be permitted to say, sir," replied Conseil, "that I never<br>
        reckoned on getting the prize; and, had the government of the Union<br>
        offered a hundred thousand dollars, it would have been none the poorer."<br>
        <br>
        "You are right, Conseil.  It is a foolish affair after all, and one<br>
        upon which we entered too lightly.  What time lost, what useless<br>
        emotions!  We should have been back in France six months ago."<br>
        <br>
        "In your little room, sir," replied Conseil, "and in your museum, sir;<br>
        and I should have already classed all your fossils, sir.  And the<br>
        Babiroussa would have been installed in its cage in the Jardin des<br>
        Plantes, and have drawn all the curious people of the capital!"<br>
        <br>
        "As you say, Conseil.  I fancy we shall run a fair chance of being<br>
        laughed at for our pains."<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site2/page2_6644.html>internal_link0_text</a><br><br>
        "That's tolerably certain," replied Conseil, quietly; "I think they<br>
        will make fun of you, sir.  And, must I say it----?"<br>
        <br>
        "Go on, my good friend."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, sir, you will only get your deserts."<br>
        <br>
        "Indeed!"<br>
        <br>
        "When one has the honour of being a _savant_ as you are, sir, one should<br>
        not expose one's self to----"<br>
        <br>
        Conseil had not time to finish his compliment.  In the midst of general<br>
        silence a voice had just been heard.  It was the voice of Ned Land<br>
        shouting:<br>
        <br>
        "Look out there!  The very thing we are looking for--on our weather<br>
        beam!"<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER VI<br>
        <br>
        AT FULL STEAM<br>
        <br>
        At this cry the whole ship's crew hurried towards the<br>
        harpooner--commander, officers, masters, sailors, cabin boys; even the<br>
        engineers left their engines, and the stokers their furnaces.<br>
        <br>
        The order to stop her had been given, and the frigate now simply went<br>
        on by her own momentum.  The darkness was then profound, and, however<br>
        good the Canadian's eyes were, I asked myself how he had managed to<br>
        see, and what he had been able to see.  My heart beat as if it would<br>
        break.  But Ned Land was not mistaken, and we all perceived the object<br>
        he pointed to.  At two cables' length from the Abraham Lincoln, on the<br>
        starboard quarter, the sea seemed to be illuminated all over.  It was<br>
        not a mere phosphoric phenomenon.  The monster emerged some fathoms<br>
        from the water, and then threw out that very intense but mysterious<br>
        light mentioned in the report of several captains.  This magnificent<br>
        irradiation must have been produced by an agent of great SHINING power.<br>
        The luminous part traced on the sea an immense oval, much elongated,<br>
        the centre of which condensed a burning heat, whose overpowering<br>
        brilliancy died out by successive gradations.<br>
        <br>
        "It is only a massing of phosphoric particles," cried one of the<br>
        officers.<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir, certainly not," I replied.  "That brightness is of an<br>
        essentially electrical nature.  Besides, see, see! it moves; it is<br>
        moving forwards, backwards; it is darting towards us!"<br>
        <br>
        A general cry arose from the frigate.<br>
        <br>
        "Silence!" said the captain.  "Up with the helm, reverse the engines."<br>
        <br>
        The steam was shut off, and the Abraham Lincoln, beating to port,<br>
        described a semicircle.<br>
        <br>
        "Right the helm, go ahead," cried the captain.<br>
        <br>
        These orders were executed, and the frigate moved rapidly from the<br>
        burning light.<br>
        <br>
        I was mistaken.  She tried to sheer off, but the supernatural animal<br>
        approached with a velocity double her own.<br>
        <br>
        We gasped for breath.  Stupefaction more than fear made us dumb and<br>
        motionless.  The animal gained on us, sporting with the waves.  It made<br>
        the round of the frigate, which was then making fourteen knots, and<br>
        enveloped it with its electric rings like luminous dust.<br>
        <br>
        Then it moved away two or three miles, leaving a phosphorescent track,<br>
        like those volumes of steam that the express trains leave behind.  All<br>
        at once from the dark line of the horizon whither it retired to gain<br>
        its momentum, the monster rushed suddenly towards the Abraham Lincoln<br>
        with alarming rapidity, stopped suddenly about twenty feet from the<br>
        hull, and died out--not diving under the water, for its brilliancy did<br>
        not abate--but suddenly, and as if the source of this brilliant<br>
        emanation was exhausted.  Then it reappeared on the other side of the<br>
        vessel, as if it had turned and slid under the hull.  Any moment a<br>
        collision might have occurred which would have been fatal to us.<br>
        However, I was astonished at the manoeuvres of the frigate.  She fled<br>
        and did not attack.<br>
        <br>
        On the captain's face, generally so impassive, was an expression of<br>
        unaccountable astonishment.<br>
        <br>
        "Mr. Aronnax," he said, "I do not know with what formidable being I<br>
        have to deal, and I will not imprudently risk my frigate in the midst<br>
        of this darkness.  Besides, how attack this unknown thing, how defend<br>
        one's self from it?  Wait for daylight, and the scene will change."<br>
        <br>
        "You have no further doubt, captain, of the nature of the animal?"<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir; it is evidently a gigantic narwhal, and an electric one."<br>
        <br>
        "Perhaps," added I, "one can only approach it with a torpedo."<br>
        <br>
        "Undoubtedly," replied the captain, "if it possesses such dreadful<br>
        power, it is the most terrible animal that ever was created.  That is<br>
        why, sir, I must be on my guard."<br>
        <br>
        The crew were on their feet all night.  No one thought of sleep.  The<br>
        Abraham Lincoln, not being able to struggle with such velocity, had<br>
        moderated its pace, and sailed at half speed.  For its part, the<br>
        narwhal, imitating the frigate, let the waves rock it at will, and<br>
        seemed decided not to leave the scene of the struggle.  Towards<br>
        midnight, however, it disappeared, or, to use a more appropriate term,<br>
        it "died out" like a large glow-worm. Had it fled?  One could only<br>
        fear, not hope it.  But at seven minutes to one o'clock in the morning<br>
        a deafening whistling was heard, like that produced by a body of water<br>
        rushing with great violence.<br>
        <br>
        The captain, Ned Land, and I were then on the poop, eagerly peering<br>
        through the profound darkness.<br>
        <br>
        "Ned Land," asked the commander, "you have often heard the roaring of<br>
        whales?"<br>
        <br>
        "Often, sir; but never such whales the sight of which brought me in two<br>
        thousand dollars.  If I can only approach within four harpoons' length<br>
        of it!"<br>
        <br>
        "But to approach it," said the commander, "I ought to put a whaler at<br>
        your disposal?"<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "That will be trifling with the lives of my men."<br>
        <br>
        "And mine too," simply said the harpooner.<br>
        <br>
        Towards two o'clock in the morning, the burning light reappeared, not<br>
        less intense, about five miles to windward of the Abraham Lincoln.<br>
        Notwithstanding the distance, and the noise of the wind and sea, one<br>
        heard distinctly the loud strokes of the animal's tail, and even its<br>
        panting breath.  It seemed that, at the moment that the enormous<br>
        narwhal had come to take breath at the surface of the water, the air<br>
        was engulfed in its lungs, like the steam in the vast cylinders of a<br>
        machine of two thousand horse-power.<br>
        <br>
        "Hum!" thought I, "a whale with the strength of a cavalry regiment<br>
        would be a pretty whale!"<br>
        <br>
        We were on the qui vive till daylight, and prepared for the combat.<br>
        The fishing implements were laid along the hammock nettings.  The<br>
        second lieutenant loaded the blunder busses, which could throw harpoons<br>
        to the distance of a mile, and long duck-guns, with explosive bullets,<br>
        which inflicted mortal wounds even to the most terrible animals.  Ned<br>
        Land contented himself with sharpening his harpoon--a terrible weapon<br>
        in his hands.<br>
        <br>
        At six o'clock day began to break; and, with the first glimmer of<br>
        light, the electric light of the narwhal disappeared.  At seven o'clock<br>
        the day was sufficiently advanced, but a very thick sea fog obscured<br>
        our view, and the best spy glasses could not pierce it.  That caused<br>
        disappointment and anger.<br>
        <br>
        I climbed the mizzen-mast. Some officers were already perched on the<br>
        mast-heads. At eight o'clock the fog lay heavily on the waves, and its<br>
        thick scrolls rose little by little.  The horizon grew wider and<br>
        clearer at the same time.  Suddenly, just as on the day before, Ned<br>
        Land's voice was heard:<br>
        <br>
        "The thing itself on the port quarter!" cried the harpooner.<br>
        <br>
        Every eye was turned towards the point indicated.  There, a mile and a<br>
        half from the frigate, a long blackish body emerged a yard above the<br>
        waves.  Its tail, violently agitated, produced a considerable eddy.<br>
        Never did a tail beat the sea with such violence.  An immense track, of<br>
        dazzling whiteness, marked the passage of the animal, and described a<br>
        long curve.<br>
        <br>
        The frigate approached the cetacean.  I examined it thoroughly.<br>
        <br>
        The reports of the Shannon and of the Helvetia had rather exaggerated<br>
        its size, and I estimated its length at only two hundred and fifty<br>
        feet.  As to its dimensions, I could only conjecture them to be<br>
        admirably proportioned.  While I watched this phenomenon, two jets of<br>
        steam and water were ejected from its vents, and rose to the height of<br>
        120 feet; thus I ascertained its way of breathing.  I concluded<br>
        definitely that it belonged to the vertebrate branch, class mammalia.<br>
        <br>
        The crew waited impatiently for their chief's orders.  The latter,<br>
        after having observed the animal attentively, called the engineer.  The<br>
        engineer ran to him.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said the commander, "you have steam up?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir," answered the engineer.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, make up your fires and put on all steam."<br>
        <br>
        Three hurrahs greeted this order.  The time for the struggle had<br>
        arrived.  Some moments after, the two funnels of the frigate vomited<br>
        torrents of black smoke, and the bridge quaked under the trembling of<br>
        the boilers.<br>
        <br>
        The Abraham Lincoln, propelled by her wonderful screw, went straight at<br>
        the animal.  The latter allowed it to come within half a cable's<br>
        length; then, as if disdaining to dive, it took a little turn, and<br>
        stopped a short distance off.<br>
        <br>
        This pursuit lasted nearly three-quarters of an hour, without the<br>
        frigate gaining two yards on the cetacean.  It was quite evident that<br>
        at that rate we should never come up with it.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Mr. Land," asked the captain, "do you advise me to put the boats<br>
        out to sea?"<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir," replied Ned Land; "because we shall not take that beast<br>
        easily."<br>
        <br>
        "What shall we do then?"<br>
        <br>
        "Put on more steam if you can, sir.  With your leave, I mean to post<br>
        myself under the bowsprit, and, if we get within harpooning distance, I<br>
        shall throw my harpoon."<br>
        <br>
        "Go, Ned," said the captain.  "Engineer, put on more pressure."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land went to his post.  The fires were increased, the screw<br>
        revolved forty-three times a minute, and the steam poured out of the<br>
        valves.  We heaved the log, and calculated that the Abraham Lincoln was<br>
        going at the rate of 18 1/2 miles an hour.<br>
        <br>
        But the accursed animal swam at the same speed.<br>
        <br>
        For a whole hour the frigate kept up this pace, without gaining six<br>
        feet.  It was humiliating for one of the swiftest sailers in the<br>
        American navy.  A stubborn anger seized the crew; the sailors abused<br>
        the monster, who, as before, disdained to answer them; the captain no<br>
        longer contented himself with twisting his beard--he gnawed it.<br>
        <br>
        The engineer was called again.<br>
        <br>
        "You have turned full steam on?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir," replied the engineer.<br>
        <br>
        The speed of the Abraham Lincoln increased.  Its masts trembled down to<br>
        their stepping holes, and the clouds of smoke could hardly find way out<br>
        of the narrow funnels.<br>
        <br>
        They heaved the log a second time.<br>
        <br>
        "Well?" asked the captain of the man at the wheel.<br>
        <br>
        "Nineteen miles and three-tenths, sir."<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site2/page2_2473.html>internal_link1_text</a><br><br>
        "Clap on more steam."<br>
        <br>
        The engineer obeyed.  The manometer showed ten degrees.  But the<br>
        cetacean grew warm itself, no doubt; for without straining itself, it<br>
        made 19 3/10 miles.<br>
        <br>
        What a pursuit!  No, I cannot describe the emotion that vibrated<br>
        through me.  Ned Land kept his post, harpoon in hand.  Several times<br>
        the animal let us gain upon it.--"We shall catch it! we shall catch<br>
        it!" cried the Canadian.  But just as he was going to strike, the<br>
        cetacean stole away with a rapidity that could not be estimated at less<br>
        than thirty miles an hour, and even during our maximum of speed, it<br>
        bullied the frigate, going round and round it.  A cry of fury broke<br>
        from everyone!<br>
        <br>
        At noon we were no further advanced than at eight o'clock in the<br>
        morning.<br>
        <br>
        The captain then decided to take more direct means.<br>
        <br>
        "Ah!" said he, "that animal goes quicker than the Abraham Lincoln.<br>
        Very well! we will see whether it will escape these conical bullets.<br>
        Send your men to the forecastle, sir."<br>
        <br>
        The forecastle gun was immediately loaded and slewed round.  But the<br>
        shot passed some feet above the cetacean, which was half a mile off.<br>
        <br>
        "Another, more to the right," cried the commander, "and five dollars to<br>
        whoever will hit that infernal beast."<br>
        <br>
        An old gunner with a grey beard--that I can see now--with steady eye<br>
        and grave face, went up to the gun and took a long aim.  A loud report<br>
        was heard, with which were mingled the cheers of the crew.<br>
        <br>
        The bullet did its work; it hit the animal, and, sliding off the<br>
        rounded surface, was lost in two miles depth of sea.<br>
        <br>
        The chase began again, and the captain, leaning towards me, said:<br>
        <br>
        "I will pursue that beast till my frigate bursts up."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," answered I; "and you will be quite right to do it."<br>
        <br>
        I wished the beast would exhaust itself, and not be insensible to<br>
        fatigue like a steam engine.  But it was of no use.  Hours passed,<br>
        without its showing any signs of exhaustion.<br>
        <br>
        However, it must be said in praise of the Abraham Lincoln that she<br>
        struggled on indefatigably.  I cannot reckon the distance she made<br>
        under three hundred miles during this unlucky day, November the 6th.<br>
        But night came on, and overshadowed the rough ocean.<br>
        <br>
        Now I thought our expedition was at an end, and that we should never<br>
        again see the extraordinary animal.  I was mistaken.  At ten minutes to<br>
        eleven in the evening, the electric light reappeared three miles to<br>
        windward of the frigate, as pure, as intense as during the preceding<br>
        night.<br>
        <br>
        The narwhal seemed motionless; perhaps, tired with its day's work, it<br>
        slept, letting itself float with the undulation of the waves.  Now was<br>
        a chance of which the captain resolved to take advantage.<br>
        <br>
        He gave his orders.  The Abraham Lincoln kept up half steam, and<br>
        advanced cautiously so as not to awake its adversary.  It is no rare<br>
        thing to meet in the middle of the ocean whales so sound asleep that<br>
        they can be successfully attacked, and Ned Land had harpooned more than<br>
        one during its sleep.  The Canadian went to take his place again under<br>
        the bowsprit.<br>
        <br>
        The frigate approached noiselessly, stopped at two cables' lengths from<br>
        the animal, and following its track.  No one breathed; a deep silence<br>
        reigned on the bridge.  We were not a hundred feet from the burning<br>
        focus, the light of which increased and dazzled our eyes.<br>
        <br>
        At this moment, leaning on the forecastle bulwark, I saw below me Ned<br>
        Land grappling the martingale in one hand, brandishing his terrible<br>
        harpoon in the other, scarcely twenty feet from the motionless animal.<br>
        Suddenly his arm straightened, and the harpoon was thrown; I heard the<br>
        sonorous stroke of the weapon, which seemed to have struck a hard body.<br>
        The electric light went out suddenly, and two enormous waterspouts<br>
        broke over the bridge of the frigate, rushing like a torrent from stem<br>
        to stern, overthrowing men, and breaking the lashings of the spars.  A<br>
        fearful shock followed, and, thrown over the rail without having time<br>
        to stop myself, I fell into the sea.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER VII<br>
        <br>
        AN UNKNOWN SPECIES OF WHALE<br>
        <br>
        This unexpected fall so stunned me that I have no clear recollection of<br>
        my sensations at the time.  I was at first drawn down to a depth of<br>
        about twenty feet.  I am a good swimmer (though without pretending to<br>
        rival Byron or Edgar Poe, who were masters of the art), and in that<br>
        plunge I did not lose my presence of mind.  Two vigorous strokes<br>
        brought me to the surface of the water.  My first care was to look for<br>
        the frigate.  Had the crew seen me disappear?  Had the Abraham Lincoln<br>
        veered round?  Would the captain put out a boat?  Might I hope to be<br>
        saved?<br>
        <br>
        The darkness was intense.  I caught a glimpse of a black mass<br>
        disappearing in the east, its beacon lights dying out in the distance.<br>
        It was the frigate!  I was lost.<br>
        <br>
        "Help, help!"  I shouted, swimming towards the Abraham Lincoln in<br>
        desperation.<br>
        <br>
        My clothes encumbered me; they seemed glued to my body, and paralysed<br>
        my movements.<br>
        <br>
        I was sinking!  I was suffocating!<br>
        <br>
        "Help!"<br>
        <br>
        This was my last cry.  My mouth filled with water; I struggled against<br>
        being drawn down the abyss.  Suddenly my clothes were seized by a<br>
        strong hand, and I felt myself quickly drawn up to the surface of the<br>
        sea; and I heard, yes, I heard these words pronounced in my ear:<br>
        <br>
        "If master would be so good as to lean on my shoulder, master would<br>
        swim with much greater ease."<br>
        <br>
        I seized with one hand my faithful Conseil's arm.<br>
        <br>
        "Is it you?" said I, "you?"<br>
        <br>
        "Myself," answered Conseil; "and waiting master's orders."<br>
        <br>
        "That shock threw you as well as me into the sea?"<br>
        <br>
        "No; but, being in my master's service, I followed him."<br>
        <br>
        The worthy fellow thought that was but natural.<br>
        <br>
        "And the frigate?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "The frigate?" replied Conseil, turning on his back; "I think that<br>
        master had better not count too much on her."<br>
        <br>
        "You think so?"<br>
        <br>
        "I say that, at the time I threw myself into the sea, I heard the men<br>
        at the wheel say, `The screw and the rudder are broken.'<br>
        <br>
        "Broken?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, broken by the monster's teeth.  It is the only injury the Abraham<br>
        Lincoln has sustained.  But it is a bad look-out for us--she no longer<br>
        answers her helm."<br>
        <br>
        "Then we are lost!"<br>
        <br>
        "Perhaps so," calmly answered Conseil.  "However, we have still several<br>
        hours before us, and one can do a good deal in some hours."<br>
        <br>
        Conseil's imperturbable coolness set me up again.  I swam more<br>
        vigorously; but, cramped by my clothes, which stuck to me like a leaden<br>
        weight, I felt great difficulty in bearing up.  Conseil saw this.<br>
        <br>
        "Will master let me make a slit?" said he; and, slipping an open knife<br>
        under my clothes, he ripped them up from top to bottom very rapidly.<br>
        Then he cleverly slipped them off me, while I swam for both of us.<br>
        <br>
        Then I did the same for Conseil, and we continued to swim near to each<br>
        other.<br>
        <br>
        Nevertheless, our situation was no less terrible.  Perhaps our<br>
        disappearance had not been noticed; and, if it had been, the frigate<br>
        could not tack, being without its helm.  Conseil argued on this<br>
        supposition, and laid his plans accordingly.  This quiet boy was<br>
        perfectly self-possessed. We then decided that, as our only chance of<br>
        safety was being picked up by the Abraham Lincoln's boats, we ought to<br>
        manage so as to wait for them as long as possible.  I resolved then to<br>
        husband our strength, so that both should not be exhausted at the same<br>
        time; and this is how we managed:  while one of us lay on our back,<br>
        quite still, with arms crossed, and legs stretched out, the other would<br>
        swim and push the other on in front.  This towing business did not last<br>
        more than ten minutes each; and relieving each other thus, we could<br>
        swim on for some hours, perhaps till day-break. Poor chance! but hope<br>
        is so firmly rooted in the heart of man!  Moreover, there were two of<br>
        us.  Indeed I declare (though it may seem improbable) if I sought to<br>
        destroy all hope--if I wished to despair, I could not.<br>
        <br>
        The collision of the frigate with the cetacean had occurred about<br>
        eleven o'clock in the evening before.  I reckoned then we should have<br>
        eight hours to swim before sunrise, an operation quite practicable if<br>
        we relieved each other.  The sea, very calm, was in our favour.<br>
        Sometimes I tried to pierce the intense darkness that was only<br>
        dispelled by the phosphorescence caused by our movements.  I watched<br>
        the luminous waves that broke over my hand, whose mirror-like surface<br>
        was spotted with silvery rings.  One might have said that we were in a<br>
        bath of quicksilver.<br>
        <br>
        Near one o'clock in the morning, I was seized with dreadful fatigue.<br>
        My limbs stiffened under the strain of violent cramp.  Conseil was<br>
        obliged to keep me up, and our preservation devolved on him alone.  I<br>
        heard the poor boy pant; his breathing became short and hurried.  I<br>
        found that he could not keep up much longer.<br>
        <br>
        "Leave me! leave me!"  I said to him.<br>
        <br>
        "Leave my master?  Never!" replied he.  "I would drown first."<br>
        <br>
        Just then the moon appeared through the fringes of a thick cloud that<br>
        the wind was driving to the east.  The surface of the sea glittered<br>
        with its rays.  This kindly light reanimated us.  My head got better<br>
        again.  I looked at all points of the horizon.  I saw the frigate!  She<br>
        was five miles from us, and looked like a dark mass, hardly<br>
        discernible.  But no boats!<br>
        <br>
        I would have cried out.  But what good would it have been at such a<br>
        distance!  My swollen lips could utter no sounds.  Conseil could<br>
        articulate some words, and I heard him repeat at intervals, "Help!<br>
        help!"<br>
        <br>
        Our movements were suspended for an instant; we listened.  It might be<br>
        only a singing in the ear, but it seemed to me as if a cry answered the<br>
        cry from Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Did you hear?"  I murmured.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes!  Yes!"<br>
        <br>
        And Conseil gave one more despairing cry.<br>
        <br>
        This time there was no mistake!  A human voice responded to ours!  Was<br>
        it the voice of another unfortunate creature, abandoned in the middle<br>
        of the ocean, some other victim of the shock sustained by the vessel?<br>
        Or rather was it a boat from the frigate, that was hailing us in the<br>
        darkness?<br>
        <br>
        Conseil made a last effort, and, leaning on my shoulder, while I struck<br>
        out in a desperate effort, he raised himself half out of the water,<br>
        then fell back exhausted.<br>
        <br>
        "What did you see?"<br>
        <br>
        "I saw----" murmured he; "I saw--but do not talk--reserve all your<br>
        strength!"<br>
        <br>
        What had he seen?  Then, I know not why, the thought of the monster<br>
        came into my head for the first time!  But that voice!  The time is<br>
        past for Jonahs to take refuge in whales' bellies!  However, Conseil<br>
        was towing me again.  He raised his head sometimes, looked before us,<br>
        and uttered a cry of recognition, which was responded to by a voice<br>
        that came nearer and nearer.  I scarcely heard it.  My strength was<br>
        exhausted; my fingers stiffened; my hand afforded me support no longer;<br>
        my mouth, convulsively opening, filled with salt water.  Cold crept<br>
        over me.  I raised my head for the last time, then I sank.<br>
        <a href=../site3/page3_848.html>external_link2_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        At this moment a hard body struck me.  I clung to it: then I felt that<br>
        I was being drawn up, that I was brought to the surface of the water,<br>
        that my chest collapsed--I fainted.<br>
        <br>
        It is certain that I soon came to, thanks to the vigorous rubbings that<br>
        I received.  I half opened my eyes.<br>
        <br>
        "Conseil!"  I murmured.<br>
        <br>
        "Does master call me?" asked Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        Just then, by the waning light of the moon which was sinking down to<br>
        the horizon, I saw a face which was not Conseil's and which I<br>
        immediately recognised.<br>
        <br>
        "Ned!"  I cried.<br>
        <br>
        "The same, sir, who is seeking his prize!" replied the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Were you thrown into the sea by the shock to the frigate?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Professor; but more fortunate than you, I was able to find a<br>
        footing almost directly upon a floating island."<br>
        <br>
        "An island?"<br>
        <br>
        "Or, more correctly speaking, on our gigantic narwhal."<br>
        <br>
        "Explain yourself, Ned!"<br>
        <br>
        "Only I soon found out why my harpoon had not entered its skin and was<br>
        blunted."<br>
        <br>
        "Why, Ned, why?"<br>
        <br>
        "Because, Professor, that beast is made of sheet iron."<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian's last words produced a sudden revolution in my brain.  I<br>
        wriggled myself quickly to the top of the being, or object, half out of<br>
        the water, which served us for a refuge.  I kicked it.  It was<br>
        evidently a hard, impenetrable body, and not the soft substance that<br>
        forms the bodies of the great marine mammalia.  But this hard body<br>
        might be a bony covering, like that of the antediluvian animals; and I<br>
        should be free to class this monster among amphibious reptiles, such as<br>
        tortoises or alligators.<br>
        <br>
        Well, no! the blackish back that supported me was smooth, polished,<br>
        without scales.  The blow produced a metallic sound; and, incredible<br>
        though it may be, it seemed, I might say, as if it was made of riveted<br>
        plates.<br>
        <br>
        There was no doubt about it!  This monster, this natural phenomenon<br>
        that had puzzled the learned world, and over thrown and misled the<br>
        imagination of seamen of both hemispheres, it must be owned was a still<br>
        more astonishing phenomenon, inasmuch as it was a simply human<br>
        construction.<br>
        <br>
        We had no time to lose, however.  We were lying upon the back of a sort<br>
        of submarine boat, which appeared (as far as I could judge) like a huge<br>
        fish of steel.  Ned Land's mind was made up on this point.  Conseil and<br>
        I could only agree with him.<br>
        <br>
        Just then a bubbling began at the back of this strange thing (which was<br>
        evidently propelled by a screw), and it began to move.  We had only<br>
        just time to seize hold of the upper part, which rose about seven feet<br>
        out of the water, and happily its speed was not great.<br>
        <br>
        "As long as it sails horizontally," muttered Ned Land, "I do not mind;<br>
        but, if it takes a fancy to dive, I would not give two straws for my<br>
        life."<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian might have said still less.  It became really necessary to<br>
        communicate with the beings, whatever they were, shut up inside the<br>
        machine.  I searched all over the outside for an aperture, a panel, or<br>
        a manhole, to use a technical expression; but the lines of the iron<br>
        rivets, solidly driven into the joints of the iron plates, were clear<br>
        and uniform.  Besides, the moon disappeared then, and left us in total<br>
        darkness.<br>
        <br>
        At last this long night passed.  My indistinct remembrance prevents my<br>
        describing all the impressions it made.  I can only recall one<br>
        circumstance.  During some lulls of the wind and sea, I fancied I heard<br>
        several times vague sounds, a sort of fugitive harmony produced by<br>
        words of command.  What was, then, the mystery of this submarine craft,<br>
        of which the whole world vainly sought an explanation?  What kind of<br>
        beings existed in this strange boat?  What mechanical agent caused its<br>
        prodigious speed?<br>
        <br>
        Daybreak appeared.  The morning mists surrounded us, but they soon<br>
        cleared off.  I was about to examine the hull, which formed on deck a<br>
        kind of horizontal platform, when I felt it gradually sinking.<br>
        <br>
        "Oh! confound it!" cried Ned Land, kicking the resounding plate.<br>
        "Open, you inhospitable rascals!"<br>
        <br>
        Happily the sinking movement ceased.  Suddenly a noise, like iron works<br>
        violently pushed aside, came from the interior of the boat.  One iron<br>
        plate was moved, a man appeared, uttered an odd cry, and disappeared<br>
        immediately.<br>
        <br>
        Some moments after, eight strong men, with masked faces, appeared<br>
        noiselessly, and drew us down into their formidable machine.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER VIII<br>
        <br>
        MOBILIS IN MOBILI<br>
        <br>
        This forcible abduction, so roughly carried out, was accomplished with<br>
        the rapidity of lightning.  I shivered all over.  Whom had we to deal<br>
        with?  No doubt some new sort of pirates, who explored the sea in their<br>
        own way.  Hardly had the narrow panel closed upon me, when I was<br>
        enveloped in darkness.  My eyes, dazzled with the outer light, could<br>
        distinguish nothing.  I felt my naked feet cling to the rungs of an<br>
        iron ladder.  Ned Land and Conseil, firmly seized, followed me.  At the<br>
        bottom of the ladder, a door opened, and shut after us immediately with<br>
        a bang.<br>
        <br>
        We were alone.  Where, I could not say, hardly imagine.  All was black,<br>
        and such a dense black that, after some minutes, my eyes had not been<br>
        able to discern even the faintest glimmer.<br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, Ned Land, furious at these proceedings, gave free vent to<br>
        his indignation.<br>
        <br>
        "Confound it!" cried he, "here are people who come up to the Scotch for<br>
        hospitality.  They only just miss being cannibals.  I should not be<br>
        surprised at it, but I declare that they shall not eat me without my<br>
        protesting."<br>
        <br>
        "Calm yourself, friend Ned, calm yourself," replied Conseil, quietly.<br>
        "Do not cry out before you are hurt.  We are not quite done for yet."<br>
        <br>
        "Not quite," sharply replied the Canadian, "but pretty near, at all<br>
        events.  Things look black.  Happily, my bowie knife I have still, and<br>
        I can always see well enough to use it.  The first of these pirates who<br>
        lays a hand on me----"<br>
        <br>
        "Do not excite yourself, Ned," I said to the harpooner, "and do not<br>
        compromise us by useless violence.  Who knows that they will not listen<br>
        to us?  Let us rather try to find out where we are."<br>
        <br>
        I groped about.  In five steps I came to an iron wall, made of plates<br>
        bolted together.  Then turning back I struck against a wooden table,<br>
        near which were ranged several stools.  The boards of this prison were<br>
        concealed under a thick mat, which deadened the noise of the feet.  The<br>
        bare walls revealed no trace of window or door.  Conseil, going round<br>
        the reverse way, met me, and we went back to the middle of the cabin,<br>
        which measured about twenty feet by ten.  As to its height, Ned Land,<br>
        in spite of his own great height, could not measure it.<br>
        <br>
        Half an hour had already passed without our situation being bettered,<br>
        when the dense darkness suddenly gave way to extreme light.  Our prison<br>
        was suddenly lighted, that is to say, it became filled with a luminous<br>
        matter, so strong that I could not bear it at first.  In its whiteness<br>
        and intensity I recognised that electric light which played round the<br>
        submarine boat like a magnificent phenomenon of phosphorescence.  After<br>
        shutting my eyes involuntarily, I opened them, and saw that this<br>
        luminous agent came from a half globe, unpolished, placed in the roof<br>
        of the cabin.<br>
        <br>
        "At last one can see," cried Ned Land, who, knife in hand, stood on the<br>
        defensive.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," said I; "but we are still in the dark about ourselves."<br>
        <br>
        "Let master have patience," said the imperturbable Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        The sudden lighting of the cabin enabled me to examine it minutely.  It<br>
        only contained a table and five stools.  The invisible door might be<br>
        hermetically sealed.  No noise was heard.  All seemed dead in the<br>
        interior of this boat.  Did it move, did it float on the surface of the<br>
        ocean, or did it dive into its depths?  I could not guess.<br>
        <br>
        A noise of bolts was now heard, the door opened, and two men appeared.<br>
        <br>
        One was short, very muscular, broad-shouldered, with robust limbs,<br>
        strong head, an abundance of black hair, thick moustache, a quick<br>
        penetrating look, and the vivacity which characterises the population<br>
        of Southern France.<br>
        <br>
        The second stranger merits a more detailed description.  I made out his<br>
        prevailing qualities directly:  self-confidence--because his head was<br>
        well set on his shoulders, and his black eyes looked around with cold<br>
        assurance; calmness--for his skin, rather pale, showed his coolness of<br>
        blood; energy--evinced by the rapid contraction of his lofty brows; and<br>
        courage--because his deep breathing denoted great power of lungs.<br>
        <br>
        Whether this person was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I could not<br>
        say.  He was tall, had a large forehead, straight nose, a clearly cut<br>
        mouth, beautiful teeth, with fine taper hands, indicative of a highly<br>
        nervous temperament.  This man was certainly the most admirable<br>
        specimen I had ever met.  One particular feature was his eyes, rather<br>
        far from each other, and which could take in nearly a quarter of the<br>
        horizon at once.<br>
        <br>
        This faculty--(I verified it later)--gave him a range of vision far<br>
        superior to Ned Land's. When this stranger fixed upon an object, his<br>
        eyebrows met, his large eyelids closed around so as to contract the<br>
        range of his vision, and he looked as if he magnified the objects<br>
        lessened by distance, as if he pierced those sheets of water so opaque<br>
        to our eyes, and as if he read the very depths of the seas.<br>
        <br>
        The two strangers, with caps made from the fur of the sea otter, and<br>
        shod with sea boots of seal's skin, were dressed in clothes of a<br>
        particular texture, which allowed free movement of the limbs.  The<br>
        taller of the two, evidently the chief on board, examined us with great<br>
        attention, without saying a word; then, turning to his companion,<br>
        talked with him in an unknown tongue.  It was a sonorous, harmonious,<br>
        and flexible dialect, the vowels seeming to admit of very varied<br>
        accentuation.<br>
        <br>
        The other replied by a shake of the head, and added two or three<br>
        perfectly incomprehensible words.  Then he seemed to question me by a<br>
        look.<br>
        <br>
        I replied in good French that I did not know his language; but he<br>
        seemed not to understand me, and my situation became more embarrassing.<br>
        <br>
        "If master were to tell our story," said Conseil, "perhaps these<br>
        gentlemen may understand some words."<br>
        <br>
        I began to tell our adventures, articulating each syllable clearly, and<br>
        without omitting one single detail.  I announced our names and rank,<br>
        introducing in person Professor Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and<br>
        master Ned Land, the harpooner.<br>
        <br>
        The man with the soft calm eyes listened to me quietly, even politely,<br>
        and with extreme attention; but nothing in his countenance indicated<br>
        that he had understood my story.  When I finished, he said not a word.<br>
        <br>
        There remained one resource, to speak English.  Perhaps they would know<br>
        this almost universal language.  I knew it--as well as the German<br>
        language--well enough to read it fluently, but not to speak it<br>
        correctly.  But, anyhow, we must make ourselves understood.<br>
        <br>
        "Go on in your turn," I said to the harpooner; "speak your best<br>
        Anglo-Saxon, and try to do better than I."<br>
        <br>
        Ned did not beg off, and recommenced our story.<br>
        <br>
        To his great disgust, the harpooner did not seem to have made himself<br>
        more intelligible than I had.  Our visitors did not stir.  They<br>
        evidently understood neither the language of England nor of France.<br>
        <br>
        Very much embarrassed, after having vainly exhausted our speaking<br>
        resources, I knew not what part to take, when Conseil said:<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site2/page2_5006.html>internal_link3_text</a><br><br>
        "If master will permit me, I will relate it in German."<br>
        <br>
        But in spite of the elegant terms and good accent of the narrator, the<br>
        German language had no success.  At last, nonplussed, I tried to<br>
        remember my first lessons, and to narrate our adventures in Latin, but<br>
        with no better success.  This last attempt being of no avail, the two<br>
        strangers exchanged some words in their unknown language, and retired.<br>
        <br>
        The door shut.<br>
        <br>
        "It is an infamous shame," cried Ned Land, who broke out for the<br>
        twentieth time.  "We speak to those rogues in French, English, German,<br>
        and Latin, and not one of them has the politeness to answer!"<br>
        <br>
        "Calm yourself," I said to the impetuous Ned; "anger will do no good."<br>
        <br>
        "But do you see, Professor," replied our irascible companion, "that we<br>
        shall absolutely die of hunger in this iron cage?"<br>
        <br>
        "Bah!" said Conseil, philosophically; "we can hold out some time yet."<br>
        <br>
        "My friends," I said, "we must not despair.  We have been worse off<br>
        than this.  Do me the favour to wait a little before forming an opinion<br>
        upon the commander and crew of this boat."<br>
        <br>
        "My opinion is formed," replied Ned Land, sharply.  "They are rascals."<br>
        <br>
        "Good! and from what country?"<br>
        <br>
        "From the land of rogues!"<br>
        <br>
        "My brave Ned, that country is not clearly indicated on the map of the<br>
        world; but I admit that the nationality of the two strangers is hard to<br>
        determine.  Neither English, French, nor German, that is quite certain.<br>
        However, I am inclined to think that the commander and his companion<br>
        were born in low latitudes.  There is southern blood in them.  But I<br>
        cannot decide by their appearance whether they are Spaniards, Turks,<br>
        Arabians, or Indians.  As to their language, it is quite<br>
        incomprehensible."<br>
        <br>
        "There is the disadvantage of not knowing all languages," said Conseil,<br>
        "or the disadvantage of not having one universal language."<br>
        <br>
        As he said these words, the door opened.  A steward entered.  He<br>
        brought us clothes, coats and trousers, made of a stuff I did not know.<br>
        I hastened to dress myself, and my companions followed my example.<br>
        During that time, the steward--dumb, perhaps deaf--had arranged the<br>
        table, and laid three plates.<br>
        <br>
        "This is something like!" said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Bah!" said the angry harpooner, "what do you suppose they eat here?<br>
        Tortoise liver, filleted shark, and beef steaks from seadogs."<br>
        <br>
        "We shall see," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        The dishes, of bell metal, were placed on the table, and we took our<br>
        places.  Undoubtedly we had to do with civilised people, and, had it<br>
        not been for the electric light which flooded us, I could have fancied<br>
        I was in the dining-room of the Adelphi Hotel at Liverpool, or at the<br>
        Grand Hotel in Paris.  I must say, however, that there was neither<br>
        bread nor wine.  The water was fresh and clear, but it was water and<br>
        did not suit Ned Land's taste.  Amongst the dishes which were brought<br>
        to us, I recognised several fish delicately dressed; but of some,<br>
        although excellent, I could give no opinion, neither could I tell to<br>
        what kingdom they belonged, whether animal or vegetable.  As to the<br>
        dinner-service, it was elegant, and in perfect taste.  Each<br>
        utensil--spoon, fork, knife, plate--had a letter engraved on it, with a<br>
        motto above it, of which this is an exact facsimile:<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        MOBILIS IN MOBILI N<br>
        <br>
        The letter N was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical<br>
        person who commanded at the bottom of the seas.<br>
        <br>
        Ned and Conseil did not reflect much.  They devoured the food, and I<br>
        did likewise.  I was, besides, reassured as to our fate; and it seemed<br>
        evident that our hosts would not let us die of want.<br>
        <br>
        However, everything has an end, everything passes away, even the hunger<br>
        of people who have not eaten for fifteen hours.  Our appetites<br>
        satisfied, we felt overcome with sleep.<br>
        <br>
        "Faith!  I shall sleep well," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "So shall I," replied Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        My two companions stretched themselves on the cabin carpet, and were<br>
        soon sound asleep.  For my own part, too many thoughts crowded my<br>
        brain, too many insoluble questions pressed upon me, too many fancies<br>
        kept my eyes half open.  Where were we?  What strange power carried us<br>
        on?  I felt--or rather fancied I felt--the machine sinking down to the<br>
        lowest beds of the sea.  Dreadful nightmares beset me; I saw in these<br>
        mysterious asylums a world of unknown animals, amongst which this<br>
        submarine boat seemed to be of the same kind, living, moving, and<br>
        formidable as they.  Then my brain grew calmer, my imagination wandered<br>
        into vague unconsciousness, and I soon fell into a deep sleep.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER IX<br>
        <br>
        NED LAND'S TEMPERS<br>
        <br>
        How long we slept I do not know; but our sleep must have lasted long,<br>
        for it rested us completely from our fatigues.  I woke first.  My<br>
        companions had not moved, and were still stretched in their corner.<br>
        <br>
        Hardly roused from my somewhat hard couch, I felt my brain freed, my<br>
        mind clear.  I then began an attentive examination of our cell.<br>
        Nothing was changed inside.  The prison was still a prison--the<br>
        prisoners, prisoners.  However, the steward, during our sleep, had<br>
        cleared the table.  I breathed with difficulty.  The heavy air seemed<br>
        to oppress my lungs.  Although the cell was large, we had evidently<br>
        consumed a great part of the oxygen that it contained.  Indeed, each<br>
        man consumes, in one hour, the oxygen contained in more than 176 pints<br>
        of air, and this air, charged (as then) with a nearly equal quantity of<br>
        carbonic acid, becomes unbreathable.<br>
        <br>
        It became necessary to renew the atmosphere of our prison, and no doubt<br>
        the whole in the submarine boat.  That gave rise to a question in my<br>
        mind.  How would the commander of this floating dwelling-place proceed?<br>
        Would he obtain air by chemical means, in getting by heat the oxygen<br>
        contained in chlorate of potash, and in absorbing carbonic acid by<br>
        caustic potash?  Or--a more convenient, economical, and consequently<br>
        more probable alternative--would he be satisfied to rise and take<br>
        breath at the surface of the water, like a whale, and so renew for<br>
        twenty-four hours the atmospheric provision?<br>
        <br>
        In fact, I was already obliged to increase my respirations to eke out<br>
        of this cell the little oxygen it contained, when suddenly I was<br>
        refreshed by a current of pure air, and perfumed with saline<br>
        emanations.  It was an invigorating sea breeze, charged with iodine.  I<br>
        opened my mouth wide, and my lungs saturated themselves with fresh<br>
        particles.<br>
        <br>
        At the same time I felt the boat rolling.  The iron-plated monster had<br>
        evidently just risen to the surface of the ocean to breathe, after the<br>
        fashion of whales.  I found out from that the mode of ventilating the<br>
        boat.<br>
        <br>
        When I had inhaled this air freely, I sought the conduit pipe, which<br>
        conveyed to us the beneficial whiff, and I was not long in finding it.<br>
        Above the door was a ventilator, through which volumes of fresh air<br>
        renewed the impoverished atmosphere of the cell.<br>
        <br>
        I was making my observations, when Ned and Conseil awoke almost at the<br>
        same time, under the influence of this reviving air.  They rubbed their<br>
        eyes, stretched themselves, and were on their feet in an instant.<br>
        <br>
        "Did master sleep well?" asked Conseil, with his usual politeness.<br>
        <br>
        "Very well, my brave boy.  And you, Mr. Land?"<br>
        <br>
        "Soundly, Professor.  But, I don't know if I am right or not, there<br>
        seems to be a sea breeze!"<br>
        <br>
        A seaman could not be mistaken, and I told the Canadian all that had<br>
        passed during his sleep.<br>
        <br>
        "Good!" said he.  "That accounts for those roarings we heard, when the<br>
        supposed narwhal sighted the Abraham Lincoln."<br>
        <br>
        "Quite so, Master Land; it was taking breath."<br>
        <br>
        "Only, Mr. Aronnax, I have no idea what o'clock it is, unless it is<br>
        dinner-time."<br>
        <br>
        "Dinner-time! my good fellow?  Say rather breakfast-time, for we<br>
        certainly have begun another day."<br>
        <br>
        "So," said Conseil, "we have slept twenty-four hours?"<br>
        <br>
        "That is my opinion."<br>
        <br>
        "I will not contradict you," replied Ned Land.  "But, dinner or<br>
        breakfast, the steward will be welcome, whichever he brings."<br>
        <br>
        "Master Land, we must conform to the rules on board, and I suppose our<br>
        appetites are in advance of the dinner hour."<br>
        <br>
        "That is just like you, friend Conseil," said Ned, impatiently.  "You<br>
        are never out of temper, always calm; you would return thanks before<br>
        grace, and die of hunger rather than complain!"<br>
        <br>
        Time was getting on, and we were fearfully hungry; and this time the<br>
        steward did not appear.  It was rather too long to leave us, if they<br>
        really had good intentions towards us.  Ned Land, tormented by the<br>
        cravings of hunger, got still more angry; and, notwithstanding his<br>
        promise, I dreaded an explosion when he found himself with one of the<br>
        crew.<br>
        <br>
        For two hours more Ned Land's temper increased; he cried, he shouted,<br>
        but in vain.  The walls were deaf.  There was no sound to be heard in<br>
        the boat; all was still as death.  It did not move, for I should have<br>
        felt the trembling motion of the hull under the influence of the screw.<br>
        Plunged in the depths of the waters, it belonged no longer to earth:<br>
        this silence was dreadful.<br>
        <br>
        I felt terrified, Conseil was calm, Ned Land roared.<br>
        <br>
        Just then a noise was heard outside.  Steps sounded on the metal flags.<br>
        The locks were turned, the door opened, and the steward appeared.<br>
        <br>
        Before I could rush forward to stop him, the Canadian had thrown him<br>
        down, and held him by the throat.  The steward was choking under the<br>
        grip of his powerful hand.<br>
        <br>
        Conseil was already trying to unclasp the harpooner's hand from his<br>
        half-suffocated victim, and I was going to fly to the rescue, when<br>
        suddenly I was nailed to the spot by hearing these words in French:<br>
        <br>
        "Be quiet, Master Land; and you, Professor, will you be so good as to<br>
        listen to me?"<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER X<br>
        <br>
        THE MAN OF THE SEAS<br>
        <br>
        It was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke.<br>
        <br>
        At these words, Ned Land rose suddenly.  The steward, nearly strangled,<br>
        tottered out on a sign from his master.  But such was the power of the<br>
        commander on board, that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which<br>
        this man must have felt towards the Canadian.  Conseil interested in<br>
        spite of himself, I stupefied, awaited in silence the result of this<br>
        scene.<br>
        <br>
        The commander, leaning against the corner of a table with his arms<br>
        folded, scanned us with profound attention.  Did he hesitate to speak?<br>
        Did he regret the words which he had just spoken in French?  One might<br>
        almost think so.<br>
        <br>
        After some moments of silence, which not one of us dreamed of breaking,<br>
        "Gentlemen," said he, in a calm and penetrating voice, "I speak French,<br>
        English, German, and Latin equally well.  I could, therefore, have<br>
        answered you at our first interview, but I wished to know you first,<br>
        then to reflect.  The story told by each one, entirely agreeing in the<br>
        main points, convinced me of your identity.  I know now that chance has<br>
        brought before me M. Pierre Aronnax, Professor of Natural History at<br>
        the Museum of Paris, entrusted with a scientific mission abroad,<br>
        Conseil, his servant, and Ned Land, of Canadian origin, harpooner on<br>
        board the frigate Abraham Lincoln of the navy of the United States of<br>
        America."<br>
        <br>
        I bowed assent.  It was not a question that the commander put to me.<br>
        Therefore there was no answer to be made.  This man expressed himself<br>
        <a href=../site1/page1_6843.html>external_link4_text</a><br><br>
        with perfect ease, without any accent.  His sentences were well turned,<br>
        his words clear, and his fluency of speech remarkable.  Yet, I did not<br>
        recognise in him a fellow-countryman.<br>
        <br>
        He continued the conversation in these terms:<br>
        <br>
        "You have doubtless thought, sir, that I have delayed long in paying<br>
        you this second visit.  The reason is that, your identity recognised, I<br>
        wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards you.  I have<br>
        hesitated much.  Most annoying circumstances have brought you into the<br>
        presence of a man who has broken all the ties of humanity.  You have<br>
        come to trouble my existence."<br>
        <br>
        "Unintentionally!" said I.<br>
        <br>
        "Unintentionally?" replied the stranger, raising his voice a little.<br>
        "Was it unintentionally that the Abraham Lincoln pursued me all over<br>
        the seas?  Was it unintentionally that you took passage in this<br>
        frigate?  Was it unintentionally that your cannon-balls rebounded off<br>
        the plating of my vessel?  Was it unintentionally that Mr. Ned Land<br>
        struck me with his harpoon?"<br>
        <br>
        I detected a restrained irritation in these words.  But to these<br>
        recriminations I had a very natural answer to make, and I made it.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said I, "no doubt you are ignorant of the discussions which have<br>
        taken place concerning you in America and Europe.  You do not know that<br>
        divers accidents, caused by collisions with your submarine machine,<br>
        have excited public feeling in the two continents.  I omit the theories<br>
        without number by which it was sought to explain that of which you<br>
        alone possess the secret.  But you must understand that, in pursuing<br>
        you over the high seas of the Pacific, the Abraham Lincoln believed<br>
        itself to be chasing some powerful sea-monster, of which it was<br>
        necessary to rid the ocean at any price."<br>
        <br>
        A half-smile curled the lips of the commander:  then, in a calmer tone:<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax," he replied, "dare you affirm that your frigate would not<br>
        as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster?"<br>
        <br>
        This question embarrassed me, for certainly Captain Farragut might not<br>
        have hesitated.  He might have thought it his duty to destroy a<br>
        contrivance of this kind, as he would a gigantic narwhal.<br>
        <br>
        "You understand then, sir," continued the stranger, "that I have the<br>
        right to treat you as enemies?"<br>
        <br>
        I answered nothing, purposely.  For what good would it be to discuss<br>
        such a proposition, when force could destroy the best arguments?<br>
        <br>
        "I have hesitated some time," continued the commander; "nothing obliged<br>
        me to show you hospitality.  If I chose to separate myself from you, I<br>
        should have no interest in seeing you again; I could place you upon the<br>
        deck of this vessel which has served you as a refuge, I could sink<br>
        beneath the waters, and forget that you had ever existed.  Would not<br>
        that be my right?"<br>
        <br>
        "It might be the right of a savage," I answered, "but not that of a<br>
        civilised man."<br>
        <br>
        "Professor," replied the commander, quickly, "I am not what you call a<br>
        civilised man!  I have done with society entirely, for reasons which I<br>
        alone have the right of appreciating.  I do not, therefore, obey its<br>
        laws, and I desire you never to allude to them before me again!"<br>
        <br>
        This was said plainly.  A flash of anger and disdain kindled in the<br>
        eyes of the Unknown, and I had a glimpse of a terrible past in the life<br>
        of this man.  Not only had he put himself beyond the pale of human<br>
        laws, but he had made himself independent of them, free in the<br>
        strictest acceptation of the word, quite beyond their reach!  Who then<br>
        would dare to pursue him at the bottom of the sea, when, on its<br>
        surface, he defied all attempts made against him?<br>
        <br>
        What vessel could resist the shock of his submarine monitor?  What<br>
        cuirass, however thick, could withstand the blows of his spur?  No man<br>
        could demand from him an account of his actions; God, if he believed in<br>
        one--his conscience, if he had one--were the sole judges to whom he was<br>
        answerable.<br>
        <br>
        These reflections crossed my mind rapidly, whilst the stranger<br>
        personage was silent, absorbed, and as if wrapped up in himself.  I<br>
        regarded him with fear mingled with interest, as, doubtless, OEdiphus<br>
        regarded the Sphinx.<br>
        <br>
        After rather a long silence, the commander resumed the conversation.<br>
        <br>
        "I have hesitated," said he, "but I have thought that my interest might<br>
        be reconciled with that pity to which every human being has a right.<br>
        You will remain on board my vessel, since fate has cast you there.  You<br>
        will be free; and, in exchange for this liberty, I shall only impose<br>
        one single condition.  Your word of honour to submit to it will<br>
        suffice."<br>
        <br>
        "Speak, sir," I answered.  "I suppose this condition is one which a man<br>
        of honour may accept?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir; it is this:  It is possible that certain events, unforeseen,<br>
        may oblige me to consign you to your cabins for some hours or some<br>
        days, as the case may be.  As I desire never to use violence, I expect<br>
        from you, more than all the others, a passive obedience.  In thus<br>
        acting, I take all the responsibility:  I acquit you entirely, for I<br>
        make it an impossibility for you to see what ought not to be seen.  Do<br>
        you accept this condition?"<br>
        <br>
        Then things took place on board which, to say the least, were singular,<br>
        and which ought not to be seen by people who were not placed beyond the<br>
        pale of social laws.  Amongst the surprises which the future was<br>
        preparing for me, this might not be the least.<br>
        <br>
        "We accept," I answered; "only I will ask your permission, sir, to<br>
        address one question to you--one only."<br>
        <br>
        "Speak, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "You said that we should be free on board."<br>
        <br>
        "Entirely."<br>
        <br>
        "I ask you, then, what you mean by this liberty?"<br>
        <br>
        "Just the liberty to go, to come, to see, to observe even all that<br>
        passes here save under rare circumstances--the liberty, in short, which<br>
        we enjoy ourselves, my companions and I."<br>
        <br>
        It was evident that we did not understand one another.<br>
        <br>
        "Pardon me, sir," I resumed, "but this liberty is only what every<br>
        prisoner has of pacing his prison.  It cannot suffice us."<br>
        <br>
        "It must suffice you, however."<br>
        <br>
        "What! we must renounce for ever seeing our country, our friends, our<br>
        relations again?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir.  But to renounce that unendurable worldly yoke which men<br>
        believe to be liberty is not perhaps so painful as you think."<br>
        <br>
        "Well," exclaimed Ned Land, "never will I give my word of honour not to<br>
        try to escape."<br>
        <br>
        "I did not ask you for your word of honour, Master Land," answered the<br>
        commander, coldly.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," I replied, beginning to get angry in spite of my self, "you<br>
        abuse your situation towards us; it is cruelty."<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir, it is clemency.  You are my prisoners of war.  I keep you,<br>
        when I could, by a word, plunge you into the depths of the ocean.  You<br>
        attacked me.  You came to surprise a secret which no man in the world<br>
        must penetrate--the secret of my whole existence.  And you think that I<br>
        am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?<br>
        Never!  In retaining you, it is not you whom I guard--it is myself."<br>
        <br>
        These words indicated a resolution taken on the part of the commander,<br>
        against which no arguments would prevail.<br>
        <br>
        "So, sir," I rejoined, "you give us simply the choice between life and<br>
        death?"<br>
        <br>
        "Simply."<br>
        <br>
        "My friends," said I, "to a question thus put, there is nothing to<br>
        answer.  But no word of honour binds us to the master of this vessel."<br>
        <br>
        "None, sir," answered the Unknown.<br>
        <br>
        Then, in a gentler tone, he continued:<br>
        <br>
        "Now, permit me to finish what I have to say to you.  I know you, M.<br>
        Aronnax.  You and your companions will not, perhaps, have so much to<br>
        complain of in the chance which has bound you to my fate.  You will<br>
        find amongst the books which are my favourite study the work which you<br>
        have published on `the depths of the sea.'  I have often read it.  You<br>
        have carried out your work as far as terrestrial science permitted you.<br>
        But you do not know all--you have not seen all.  Let me tell you then,<br>
        Professor, that you will not regret the time passed on board my vessel.<br>
        You are going to visit the land of marvels."<br>
        <br>
        These words of the commander had a great effect upon me.  I cannot deny<br>
        it.  My weak point was touched; and I forgot, for a moment, that the<br>
        contemplation of these sublime subjects was not worth the loss of<br>
        liberty.  Besides, I trusted to the future to decide this grave<br>
        question.  So I contented myself with saying:<br>
        <br>
        "By what name ought I to address you?"<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," replied the commander, "I am nothing to you but Captain Nemo;<br>
        and you and your companions are nothing to me but the passengers of the<br>
        Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo called.  A steward appeared.  The captain gave him his<br>
        orders in that strange language which I did not understand.  Then,<br>
        turning towards the Canadian and Conseil:<br>
        <br>
        "A repast awaits you in your cabin," said he.  "Be so good as to follow<br>
        this man.<br>
        <br>
        "And now, M. Aronnax, our breakfast is ready.  Permit me to lead the<br>
        way."<br>
        <br>
        "I am at your service, Captain."<br>
        <br>
        I followed Captain Nemo; and as soon as I had passed through the door,<br>
        I found myself in a kind of passage lighted by electricity, similar to<br>
        the waist of a ship.  After we had proceeded a dozen yards, a second<br>
        door opened before me.<br>
        <br>
        I then entered a dining-room, decorated and furnished in severe taste.<br>
        High oaken sideboards, inlaid with ebony, stood at the two extremities<br>
        of the room, and upon their shelves glittered china, porcelain, and<br>
        glass of inestimable value.  The plate on the table sparkled in the<br>
        rays which the luminous ceiling shed around, while the light was<br>
        tempered and softened by exquisite paintings.<br>
        <br>
        In the centre of the room was a table richly laid out.  Captain Nemo<br>
        indicated the place I was to occupy.<br>
        <br>
        The breakfast consisted of a certain number of dishes, the contents of<br>
        which were furnished by the sea alone; and I was ignorant of the nature<br>
        and mode of preparation of some of them.  I acknowledged that they were<br>
        good, but they had a peculiar flavour, which I easily became accustomed<br>
        to.  These different aliments appeared to me to be rich in phosphorus,<br>
        and I thought they must have a marine origin.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo looked at me.  I asked him no questions, but he guessed my<br>
        thoughts, and answered of his own accord the questions which I was<br>
        burning to address to him.<br>
        <br>
        "The greater part of these dishes are unknown to you," he said to me.<br>
        "However, you may partake of them without fear.  They are wholesome and<br>
        nourishing.  For a long time I have renounced the food of the earth,<br>
        and I am never ill now.  My crew, who are healthy, are fed on the same<br>
        food."<br>
        <br>
        "So," said I, "all these eatables are the produce of the sea?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Professor, the sea supplies all my wants.  Sometimes I cast my<br>
        nets in tow, and I draw them in ready to break.  Sometimes I hunt in<br>
        the midst of this element, which appears to be inaccessible to man, and<br>
        quarry the game which dwells in my submarine forests.  My flocks, like<br>
        those of Neptune's old shepherds, graze fearlessly in the immense<br>
        prairies of the ocean.  I have a vast property there, which I cultivate<br>
        myself, and which is always sown by the hand of the Creator of all<br>
        things."<br>
        <br>
        "I can understand perfectly, sir, that your nets furnish excellent fish<br>
        for your table; I can understand also that you hunt aquatic game in<br>
        your submarine forests; but I cannot understand at all how a particle<br>
        of meat, no matter how small, can figure in your bill of fare."<br>
