        "But of what use is this refuge, Captain?  The Nautilus wants no port."<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir; but it wants electricity to make it move, and the wherewithal<br>
        to make the electricity--sodium to feed the elements, coal from which<br>
        to get the sodium, and a coal-mine to supply the coal.  And exactly on<br>
        this spot the sea covers entire forests embedded during the geological<br>
        periods, now mineralised and transformed into coal; for me they are an<br>
        inexhaustible mine."<br>
        <br>
        "Your men follow the trade of miners here, then, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "Exactly so.  These mines extend under the waves like the mines of<br>
        Newcastle.  Here, in their diving-dresses, pick axe and shovel in hand,<br>
        my men extract the coal, which I do not even ask from the mines of the<br>
        earth.  When I burn this combustible for the manufacture of sodium, the<br>
        smoke, escaping from the crater of the mountain, gives it the<br>
        appearance of a still-active volcano."<br>
        <br>
        "And we shall see your companions at work?"<br>
        <br>
        "No; not this time at least; for I am in a hurry to continue our<br>
        submarine tour of the earth.  So I shall content myself with drawing<br>
        from the reserve of sodium I already possess.  The time for loading is<br>
        one day only, and we continue our voyage.  So, if you wish to go over<br>
        the cavern and make the round of the lagoon, you must take advantage of<br>
        to-day, M. Aronnax."<br>
        <br>
        I thanked the Captain and went to look for my companions, who had not<br>
        yet left their cabin.  I invited them to follow me without saying where<br>
        we were.  They mounted the platform.  Conseil, who was astonished at<br>
        nothing, seemed to look upon it as quite natural that he should wake<br>
        under a mountain, after having fallen asleep under the waves.  But Ned<br>
        Land thought of nothing but finding whether the cavern had any exit.<br>
        After breakfast, about ten o'clock, we went down on to the mountain.<br>
        <br>
        "Here we are, once more on land," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "I do not call this land," said the Canadian.  "And besides, we are not<br>
        on it, but beneath it."<br>
        <br>
        Between the walls of the mountains and the waters of the lake lay a<br>
        sandy shore which, at its greatest breadth, measured five hundred feet.<br>
        On this soil one might easily make the tour of the lake.  But the base<br>
        of the high partitions was stony ground, with volcanic locks and<br>
        enormous pumice-stones lying in picturesque heaps.  All these detached<br>
        masses, covered with enamel, polished by the action of the<br>
        subterraneous fires, shone resplendent by the light of our electric<br>
        lantern.  The mica dust from the shore, rising under our feet, flew<br>
        like a cloud of sparks.  The bottom now rose sensibly, and we soon<br>
        arrived at long circuitous slopes, or inclined planes, which took us<br>
        higher by degrees; but we were obliged to walk carefully among these<br>
        conglomerates, bound by no cement, the feet slipping on the glassy<br>
        crystal, felspar, and quartz.<br>
        <br>
        The volcanic nature of this enormous excavation was confirmed on all<br>
        sides, and I pointed it out to my companions.<br>
        <br>
        "Picture to yourselves," said I, "what this crater must have been when<br>
        filled with boiling lava, and when the level of the incandescent liquid<br>
        rose to the orifice of the mountain, as though melted on the top of a<br>
        hot plate."<br>
        <br>
        "I can picture it perfectly," said Conseil.  "But, sir, will you tell<br>
        me why the Great Architect has suspended operations, and how it is that<br>
        the furnace is replaced by the quiet waters of the lake?"<br>
        <br>
        "Most probably, Conseil, because some convulsion beneath the ocean<br>
        produced that very opening which has served as a passage for the<br>
        Nautilus.  Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed into the interior of<br>
        the mountain.  There must have been a terrible struggle between the two<br>
        elements, a struggle which ended in the victory of Neptune.  But many<br>
        ages have run out since then, and the submerged volcano is now a<br>
        peaceable grotto."<br>
        <br>
        "Very well," replied Ned Land; "I accept the explanation, sir; but, in<br>
        our own interests, I regret that the opening of which you speak was not<br>
        made above the level of the sea."<br>
        <br>
        "But, friend Ned," said Conseil, "if the passage had not been under the<br>
        sea, the Nautilus could not have gone through it."<br>
        <br>
        We continued ascending.  The steps became more and more perpendicular<br>
        and narrow.  Deep excavations, which we were obliged to cross, cut them<br>
        here and there; sloping masses had to be turned.  We slid upon our<br>
        knees and crawled along.  But Conseil's dexterity and the Canadian's<br>
        strength surmounted all obstacles.  At a height of about 31 feet the<br>
        nature of the ground changed without becoming more practicable.  To the<br>
        conglomerate and trachyte succeeded black basalt, the first dispread in<br>
        layers full of bubbles, the latter forming regular prisms, placed like<br>
        a colonnade supporting the spring of the immense vault, an admirable<br>
        specimen of natural architecture.  Between the blocks of basalt wound<br>
        long streams of lava, long since grown cold, encrusted with bituminous<br>
        rays; and in some places there were spread large carpets of sulphur.  A<br>
        more powerful light shone through the upper crater, shedding a vague<br>
        glimmer over these volcanic depressions for ever buried in the bosom of<br>
        this extinguished mountain.  But our upward march was soon stopped at a<br>
        height of about two hundred and fifty feet by impassable obstacles.<br>
        There was a complete vaulted arch overhanging us, and our ascent was<br>
        changed to a circular walk.  At the last change vegetable life began to<br>
        struggle with the mineral.  Some shrubs, and even some trees, grew from<br>
        the fractures of the walls.  I recognised some euphorbias, with the<br>
        caustic sugar coming from them; heliotropes, quite incapable of<br>
        justifying their name, sadly drooped their clusters of flowers, both<br>
        their colour and perfume half gone.  Here and there some chrysanthemums<br>
        grew timidly at the foot of an aloe with long, sickly-looking leaves.<br>
        But between the streams of lava, I saw some little violets still<br>
        slightly perfumed, and I admit that I smelt them with delight.  Perfume<br>
        is the soul of the flower, and sea-flowers have no soul.<br>
        <br>
        We had arrived at the foot of some sturdy dragon-trees, which had<br>
        pushed aside the rocks with their strong roots, when Ned Land exclaimed:<br>
        <br>
        "Ah! sir, a hive! a hive!"<br>
        <br>
        "A hive!"  I replied, with a gesture of incredulity.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, a hive," repeated the Canadian, "and bees humming round it."<br>
        <br>
        I approached, and was bound to believe my own eyes.  There at a hole<br>
        bored in one of the dragon-trees were some thousands of these ingenious<br>
        insects, so common in all the Canaries, and whose produce is so much<br>
        esteemed.  Naturally enough, the Canadian wished to gather the honey,<br>
        and I could not well oppose his wish.  A quantity of dry leaves, mixed<br>
        with sulphur, he lit with a spark from his flint, and he began to smoke<br>
        out the bees.  The humming ceased by degrees, and the hive eventually<br>
        yielded several pounds of the sweetest honey, with which Ned Land<br>
        filled his haversack.<br>
        <br>
        "When I have mixed this honey with the paste of the bread-fruit," said<br>
        he, "I shall be able to offer you a succulent cake."<br>
        <br>
        [Transcriber's Note: 'bread-fruit' has been substituted for<br>
        'artocarpus' in this ed.]<br>
        <br>
        "'Pon my word," said Conseil, "it will be gingerbread."<br>
        <br>
        "Never mind the gingerbread," said I; "let us continue our interesting<br>
        walk."<br>
        <br>
        At every turn of the path we were following, the lake appeared in all<br>
        its length and breadth.  The lantern lit up the whole of its peaceable<br>
        surface, which knew neither ripple nor wave.  The Nautilus remained<br>
        perfectly immovable.  On the platform, and on the mountain, the ship's<br>
        crew were working like black shadows clearly carved against the<br>
        luminous atmosphere.  We were now going round the highest crest of the<br>
        first layers of rock which upheld the roof.  I then saw that bees were<br>
        not the only representatives of the animal kingdom in the interior of<br>
        this volcano.  Birds of prey hovered here and there in the shadows, or<br>
        fled from their nests on the top of the rocks.  There were sparrow<br>
        hawks, with white breasts, and kestrels, and down the slopes scampered,<br>
        with their long legs, several fine fat bustards.  I leave anyone to<br>
        imagine the covetousness of the Canadian at the sight of this savoury<br>
        game, and whether he did not regret having no gun.  But he did his best<br>
        to replace the lead by stones, and, after several fruitless attempts,<br>
        he succeeded in wounding a magnificent bird.  To say that he risked his<br>
        life twenty times before reaching it is but the truth; but he managed<br>
        so well that the creature joined the honey-cakes in his bag.  We were<br>
        now obliged to descend toward the shore, the crest becoming<br>
        impracticable.  Above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a<br>
        well.  From this place the sky could be clearly seen, and clouds,<br>
        dissipated by the west wind, leaving behind them, even on the summit of<br>
        the mountain, their misty remnants--certain proof that they were only<br>
        moderately high, for the volcano did not rise more than eight hundred<br>
        feet above the level of the ocean.  Half an hour after the Canadian's<br>
        last exploit we had regained the inner shore.  Here the flora was<br>
        represented by large carpets of marine crystal, a little umbelliferous<br>
        plant very good to pickle, which also bears the name of pierce-stone<br>
        and sea-fennel. Conseil gathered some bundles of it.  As to the fauna,<br>
        it might be counted by thousands of crustacea of all sorts, lobsters,<br>
        crabs, spider-crabs, chameleon shrimps, and a large number of shells,<br>
        rockfish, and limpets.  Three-quarters of an hour later we had finished<br>
        our circuitous walk and were on board.  The crew had just finished<br>
        loading the sodium, and the Nautilus could have left that instant.  But<br>
        Captain Nemo gave no order.  Did he wish to wait until night, and leave<br>
        the submarine passage secretly?  Perhaps so.  Whatever it might be, the<br>
        next day, the Nautilus, having left its port, steered clear of all land<br>
        at a few yards beneath the waves of the Atlantic.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XI<br>
        <br>
        THE SARGASSO SEA<br>
        <br>
        That day the Nautilus crossed a singular part of the Atlantic Ocean.<br>
        No one can be ignorant of the existence of a current of warm water<br>
        known by the name of the Gulf Stream.  After leaving the Gulf of<br>
        Florida, we went in the direction of Spitzbergen.  But before entering<br>
        the Gulf of Mexico, about 45° of N. lat., this current divides into<br>
        two arms, the principal one going towards the coast of Ireland and<br>
        Norway, whilst the second bends to the south about the height of the<br>
        Azores; then, touching the African shore, and describing a lengthened<br>
        oval, returns to the Antilles.  This second arm--it is rather a collar<br>
        than an arm--surrounds with its circles of warm water that portion of<br>
        the cold, quiet, immovable ocean called the Sargasso Sea, a perfect<br>
        lake in the open Atlantic: it takes no less than three years for the<br>
        great current to pass round it.  Such was the region the Nautilus was<br>
        now visiting, a perfect meadow, a close carpet of seaweed, fucus, and<br>
        tropical berries, so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel<br>
        could hardly tear its way through it.  And Captain Nemo, not wishing to<br>
        entangle his screw in this herbaceous mass, kept some yards beneath the<br>
        surface of the waves.  The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word<br>
        "sargazzo" which signifies kelp.  This kelp, or berry-plant, is the<br>
        principal formation of this immense bank.  And this is the reason why<br>
        <a href=../site2/page2_2473.html>internal_link0_text</a><br><br>
        these plants unite in the peaceful basin of the Atlantic.  The only<br>
        explanation which can be given, he says, seems to me to result from the<br>
        experience known to all the world.  Place in a vase some fragments of<br>
        cork or other floating body, and give to the water in the vase a<br>
        circular movement, the scattered fragments will unite in a group in the<br>
        centre of the liquid surface, that is to say, in the part least<br>
        agitated.  In the phenomenon we are considering, the Atlantic is the<br>
        vase, the Gulf Stream the circular current, and the Sargasso Sea the<br>
        central point at which the floating bodies unite.<br>
        <br>
        I share Maury's opinion, and I was able to study the phenomenon in the<br>
        very midst, where vessels rarely penetrate.  Above us floated products<br>
        of all kinds, heaped up among these brownish plants; trunks of trees<br>
        torn from the Andes or the Rocky Mountains, and floated by the Amazon<br>
        or the Mississippi; numerous wrecks, remains of keels, or ships'<br>
        bottoms, side-planks stove in, and so weighted with shells and<br>
        barnacles that they could not again rise to the surface.  And time will<br>
        one day justify Maury's other opinion, that these substances thus<br>
        accumulated for ages will become petrified by the action of the water<br>
        and will then form inexhaustible coal-mines--a precious reserve<br>
        prepared by far-seeing Nature for the moment when men shall have<br>
        exhausted the mines of continents.<br>
        <br>
        In the midst of this inextricable mass of plants and sea weed, I<br>
        noticed some charming pink halcyons and actiniae, with their long<br>
        tentacles trailing after them, and medusae, green, red, and blue.<br>
        <br>
        All the day of the 22nd of February we passed in the Sargasso Sea,<br>
        where such fish as are partial to marine plants find abundant<br>
        nourishment.  The next, the ocean had returned to its accustomed<br>
        aspect.  From this time for nineteen days, from the 23rd of February to<br>
        the 12th of March, the Nautilus kept in the middle of the Atlantic,<br>
        carrying us at a constant speed of a hundred leagues in twenty-four<br>
        hours.  Captain Nemo evidently intended accomplishing his submarine<br>
        programme, and I imagined that he intended, after doubling Cape Horn,<br>
        to return to the Australian seas of the Pacific.  Ned Land had cause<br>
        for fear.  In these large seas, void of islands, we could not attempt<br>
        to leave the boat.  Nor had we any means of opposing Captain Nemo's<br>
        will.  Our only course was to submit; but what we could neither gain by<br>
        force nor cunning, I liked to think might be obtained by persuasion.<br>
        This voyage ended, would he not consent to restore our liberty, under<br>
        an oath never to reveal his existence?--an oath of honour which we<br>
        should have religiously kept.  But we must consider that delicate<br>
        question with the Captain.  But was I free to claim this liberty?  Had<br>
        he not himself said from the beginning, in the firmest manner, that the<br>
        secret of his life exacted from him our lasting imprisonment on board<br>
        the Nautilus?  And would not my four months' silence appear to him a<br>
        tacit acceptance of our situation?  And would not a return to the<br>
        subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our<br>
        projects, if at some future time a favourable opportunity offered to<br>
        return to them?<br>
        <br>
        During the nineteen days mentioned above, no incident of any kind<br>
        happened to signalise our voyage.  I saw little of the Captain; he was<br>
        at work.  In the library I often found his books left open, especially<br>
        those on natural history.  My work on submarine depths, conned over by<br>
        him, was covered with marginal notes, often contradicting my theories<br>
        and systems; but the Captain contented himself with thus purging my<br>
        work; it was very rare for him to discuss it with me.  Sometimes I<br>
        heard the melancholy tones of his organ; but only at night, in the<br>
        midst of the deepest obscurity, when the Nautilus slept upon the<br>
        deserted ocean.  During this part of our voyage we sailed whole days on<br>
        the surface of the waves.  The sea seemed abandoned.  A few<br>
        sailing-vessels, on the road to India, were making for the Cape of Good<br>
        Hope.  One day we were followed by the boats of a whaler, who, no<br>
        doubt, took us for some enormous whale of great price; but Captain Nemo<br>
        did not wish the worthy fellows to lose their time and trouble, so<br>
        ended the chase by plunging under the water.  Our navigation continued<br>
        until the 13th of March; that day the Nautilus was employed in taking<br>
        soundings, which greatly interested me.  We had then made about 13,000<br>
        leagues since our departure from the high seas of the Pacific.  The<br>
        bearings gave us 45° 37' S. lat., and 37° 53' W. long.  It was<br>
        the same water in which Captain Denham of the Herald sounded 7,000<br>
        fathoms without finding the bottom.  There, too, Lieutenant Parker, of<br>
        the American frigate Congress, could not touch the bottom with 15,140<br>
        fathoms.  Captain Nemo intended seeking the bottom of the ocean by a<br>
        diagonal sufficiently lengthened by means of lateral planes placed at<br>
        an angle of 45° with the water-line of the Nautilus.  Then the<br>
        screw set to work at its maximum speed, its four blades beating the<br>
        waves with in describable force.  Under this powerful pressure, the<br>
        hull of the Nautilus quivered like a sonorous chord and sank regularly<br>
        under the water.<br>
        <br>
        At 7,000 fathoms I saw some blackish tops rising from the midst of the<br>
        waters; but these summits might belong to high mountains like the<br>
        Himalayas or Mont Blanc, even higher; and the depth of the abyss<br>
        remained incalculable.  The Nautilus descended still lower, in spite of<br>
        the great pressure.  I felt the steel plates tremble at the fastenings<br>
        of the bolts; its bars bent, its partitions groaned; the windows of the<br>
        saloon seemed to curve under the pressure of the waters.  And this firm<br>
        structure would doubtless have yielded, if, as its Captain had said, it<br>
        had not been capable of resistance like a solid block.  We had attained<br>
        a depth of 16,000 yards (four leagues), and the sides of the Nautilus<br>
        then bore a pressure of 1,600 atmospheres, that is to say, 3,200 lb.<br>
        to each square two-fifths of an inch of its surface.<br>
        <br>
        "What a situation to be in!"  I exclaimed.  "To overrun these deep<br>
        regions where man has never trod!  Look, Captain, look at these<br>
        magnificent rocks, these uninhabited grottoes, these lowest receptacles<br>
        of the globe, where life is no longer possible!  What unknown sights<br>
        are here!  Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?"<br>
        <br>
        "Would you like to carry away more than the remembrance?" said Captain<br>
        Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "What do you mean by those words?"<br>
        <br>
        "I mean to say that nothing is easier than to make a photographic view<br>
        of this submarine region."<br>
        <br>
        I had not time to express my surprise at this new proposition, when, at<br>
        Captain Nemo's call, an objective was brought into the saloon.  Through<br>
        the widely-opened panel, the liquid mass was bright with electricity,<br>
        which was distributed with such uniformity that not a shadow, not a<br>
        gradation, was to be seen in our manufactured light.  The Nautilus<br>
        remained motionless, the force of its screw subdued by the inclination<br>
        of its planes: the instrument was propped on the bottom of the oceanic<br>
        site, and in a few seconds we had obtained a perfect negative.<br>
        <br>
        But, the operation being over, Captain Nemo said, "Let us go up; we<br>
        must not abuse our position, nor expose the Nautilus too long to such<br>
        great pressure."<br>
        <br>
        "Go up again!"  I exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        "Hold well on."<br>
        <br>
        I had not time to understand why the Captain cautioned me thus, when I<br>
        was thrown forward on to the carpet.  At a signal from the Captain, its<br>
        screw was shipped, and its blades raised vertically; the Nautilus shot<br>
        into the air like a balloon, rising with stunning rapidity, and cutting<br>
        the mass of waters with a sonorous agitation.  Nothing was visible; and<br>
        in four minutes it had shot through the four leagues which separated it<br>
        from the ocean, and, after emerging like a flying-fish, fell, making<br>
        the waves rebound to an enormous height.<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        CHAPTER XII<br>
        <br>
        CACHALOTS AND WHALES<br>
        <br>
        During the nights of the 13th and 14th of March, the Nautilus returned<br>
        to its southerly course.  I fancied that, when on a level with Cape<br>
        Horn, he would turn the helm westward, in order to beat the Pacific<br>
        seas, and so complete the tour of the world.  He did nothing of the<br>
        kind, but continued on his way to the southern regions.  Where was he<br>
        going to?  To the pole?  It was madness!  I began to think that the<br>
        Captain's temerity justified Ned Land's fears.  For some time past the<br>
        Canadian had not spoken to me of his projects of flight; he was less<br>
        communicative, almost silent.  I could see that this lengthened<br>
        imprisonment was weighing upon him, and I felt that rage was burning<br>
        within him.  When he met the Captain, his eyes lit up with suppressed<br>
        anger; and I feared that his natural violence would lead him into some<br>
        extreme.  That day, the 14th of March, Conseil and he came to me in my<br>
        room.  I inquired the cause of their visit.<br>
        <br>
        "A simple question to ask you, sir," replied the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Speak, Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "How many men are there on board the Nautilus, do you think?"<br>
        <br>
        "I cannot tell, my friend."<br>
        <br>
        "I should say that its working does not require a large crew."<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly, under existing conditions, ten men, at the most, ought to<br>
        be enough."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, why should there be any more?"<br>
        <br>
        "Why?"  I replied, looking fixedly at Ned Land, whose meaning was easy<br>
        to guess.  "Because," I added, "if my surmises are correct, and if I<br>
        have well understood the Captain's existence, the Nautilus is not only<br>
        a vessel: it is also a place of refuge for those who, like its<br>
        commander, have broken every tie upon earth."<br>
        <br>
        "Perhaps so," said Conseil; "but, in any case, the Nautilus can only<br>
        contain a certain number of men.  Could not you, sir, estimate their<br>
        maximum?"<br>
        <br>
        "How, Conseil?"<br>
        <br>
        "By calculation; given the size of the vessel, which you know, sir, and<br>
        consequently the quantity of air it contains, knowing also how much<br>
        each man expends at a breath, and comparing these results with the fact<br>
        that the Nautilus is obliged to go to the surface every twenty-four<br>
        hours."<br>
        <br>
        Conseil had not finished the sentence before I saw what he was driving<br>
        at.<br>
        <br>
        "I understand," said I; "but that calculation, though simple enough,<br>
        can give but a very uncertain result."<br>
        <br>
        "Never mind," said Ned Land urgently.<br>
        <br>
        "Here it is, then," said I. "In one hour each man consumes the oxygen<br>
        contained in twenty gallons of air; and in twenty-four, that contained<br>
        in 480 gallons.  We must, therefore find how many times 480 gallons of<br>
        air the Nautilus contains."<br>
        <br>
        "Just so," said Conseil.<br>
        <a href=../site3/page3_9427.html>external_link1_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        "Or," I continued, "the size of the Nautilus being 1,500 tons; and one<br>
        ton holding 200 gallons, it contains 300,000 gallons of air, which,<br>
        divided by 480, gives a quotient of 625.  Which means to say, strictly<br>
        speaking, that the air contained in the Nautilus would suffice for 625<br>
        men for twenty-four hours."<br>
        <br>
        "Six hundred and twenty-five!" repeated Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "But remember that all of us, passengers, sailors, and officers<br>
        included, would not form a tenth part of that number."<br>
        <br>
        "Still too many for three men," murmured Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian shook his head, passed his hand across his forehead, and<br>
        left the room without answering.<br>
        <br>
        "Will you allow me to make one observation, sir?" said Conseil.  "Poor<br>
        Ned is longing for everything that he can not have.  His past life is<br>
        always present to him; everything that we are forbidden he regrets.<br>
        His head is full of old recollections.  And we must understand him.<br>
        What has he to do here?  Nothing; he is not learned like you, sir; and<br>
        has not the same taste for the beauties of the sea that we have.  He<br>
        would risk everything to be able to go once more into a tavern in his<br>
        own country."<br>
        <br>
        Certainly the monotony on board must seem intolerable to the Canadian,<br>
        accustomed as he was to a life of liberty and activity.  Events were<br>
        rare which could rouse him to any show of spirit; but that day an event<br>
        did happen which recalled the bright days of the harpooner.  About<br>
        eleven in the morning, being on the surface of the ocean, the Nautilus<br>
        fell in with a troop of whales--an encounter which did not astonish me,<br>
        knowing that these creatures, hunted to death, had taken refuge in high<br>
        latitudes.<br>
        <br>
        We were seated on the platform, with a quiet sea.  The month of October<br>
        in those latitudes gave us some lovely autumnal days.  It was the<br>
        Canadian--he could not be mistaken--who signalled a whale on the<br>
        eastern horizon.  Looking attentively, one might see its black back<br>
        rise and fall with the waves five miles from the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        "Ah!" exclaimed Ned Land, "if I was on board a whaler, now such a<br>
        meeting would give me pleasure.  It is one of large size.  See with<br>
        what strength its blow-holes throw up columns of air an steam!<br>
        Confound it, why am I bound to these steel plates?"<br>
        <br>
        "What, Ned," said I, "you have not forgotten your old ideas of fishing?"<br>
        <br>
        "Can a whale-fisher ever forget his old trade, sir?  Can he ever tire<br>
        of the emotions caused by such a chase?"<br>
        <br>
        "You have never fished in these seas, Ned?"<br>
        <br>
        "Never, sir; in the northern only, and as much in Behring as in Davis<br>
        Straits."<br>
        <br>
        "Then the southern whale is still unknown to you.  It is the Greenland<br>
        whale you have hunted up to this time, and that would not risk passing<br>
        through the warm waters of the equator.  Whales are localised,<br>
        according to their kinds, in certain seas which they never leave.  And<br>
        if one of these creatures went from Behring to Davis Straits, it must<br>
        be simply because there is a passage from one sea to the other, either<br>
        on the American or the Asiatic side."<br>
        <br>
        "In that case, as I have never fished in these seas, I do not know the<br>
        kind of whale frequenting them!"<br>
        <br>
        "I have told you, Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "A greater reason for making their acquaintance," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Look! look!" exclaimed the Canadian, "they approach: they aggravate<br>
        me; they know that I cannot get at them!"<br>
        <br>
        Ned stamped his feet.  His hand trembled, as he grasped an imaginary<br>
        harpoon.<br>
        <br>
        "Are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas?" asked he.<br>
        <br>
        "Very nearly, Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "Because I have seen large whales, sir, whales measuring a hundred<br>
        feet.  I have even been told that those of Hullamoch and Umgallick, of<br>
        the Aleutian Islands, are sometimes a hundred and fifty feet long."<br>
        <br>
        "That seems to me exaggeration. These creatures are only<br>
        balaeaopterons, provided with dorsal fins; and, like the cachalots, are<br>
        generally much smaller than the Greenland whale."<br>
        <br>
        "Ah!" exclaimed the Canadian, whose eyes had never left the ocean,<br>
        "they are coming nearer; they are in the same water as the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        Then, returning to the conversation, he said:<br>
        <br>
        "You spoke of the cachalot as a small creature.  I have heard of<br>
        gigantic ones.  They are intelligent cetacea.  It is said of some that<br>
        they cover themselves with seaweed and fucus, and then are taken for<br>
        islands.  People encamp upon them, and settle there; lights a fire----"<br>
        <br>
        "And build houses," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, joker," said Ned Land.  "And one fine day the creature plunges,<br>
        carrying with it all the inhabitants to the bottom of the sea."<br>
        <br>
        "Something like the travels of Sinbad the Sailor," I replied, laughing.<br>
        <br>
        "Ah!" suddenly exclaimed Ned Land, "it is not one whale; there are<br>
        ten--there are twenty--it is a whole troop!  And I not able to do<br>
        anything! hands and feet tied!"<br>
        <br>
        "But, friend Ned," said Conseil, "why do you not ask Captain Nemo's<br>
        permission to chase them?"<br>
        <br>
        Conseil had not finished his sentence when Ned Land had lowered himself<br>
        through the panel to seek the Captain.  A few minutes afterwards the<br>
        two appeared together on the platform.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo watched the troop of cetacea playing on the waters about a<br>
        mile from the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        "They are southern whales," said he; "there goes the fortune of a whole<br>
        fleet of whalers."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, sir," asked the Canadian, "can I not chase them, if only to<br>
        remind me of my old trade of harpooner?"<br>
        <br>
        "And to what purpose?" replied Captain Nemo; "only to destroy!  We have<br>
        nothing to do with the whale-oil on board."<br>
        <br>
        "But, sir," continued the Canadian, "in the Red Sea you allowed us to<br>
        follow the dugong."<br>
        <br>
        "Then it was to procure fresh meat for my crew.  Here it would be<br>
        killing for killing's sake.  I know that is a privilege reserved for<br>
        man, but I do not approve of such murderous pastime.  In destroying the<br>
        southern whale (like the Greenland whale, an inoffensive creature),<br>
        your traders do a culpable action, Master Land.  They have already<br>
        depopulated the whole of Baffin's Bay, and are annihilating a class of<br>
        useful animals.  Leave the unfortunate cetacea alone.  They have plenty<br>
        of natural enemies--cachalots, swordfish, and sawfish--without you<br>
        troubling them."<br>
        <br>
        The Captain was right.  The barbarous and inconsiderate greed of these<br>
        fishermen will one day cause the disappearance of the last whale in the<br>
        ocean.  Ned Land whistled "Yankee-doodle" between his teeth, thrust his<br>
        hands into his pockets, and turned his back upon us.  But Captain Nemo<br>
        watched the troop of cetacea, and, addressing me, said:<br>
        <br>
        "I was right in saying that whales had natural enemies enough, without<br>
        counting man.  These will have plenty to do before long.  Do you see,<br>
        M. Aronnax, about eight miles to leeward, those blackish moving points?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Captain," I replied.<br>
        <br>
        "Those are cachalots--terrible animals, which I have met in troops of<br>
        two or three hundred.  As to those, they are cruel, mischievous<br>
        creatures; they would be right in exterminating them."<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian turned quickly at the last words.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Captain," said he, "it is still time, in the interest of the<br>
        whales."<br>
        <br>
        "It is useless to expose one's self, Professor.  The Nautilus will<br>
        disperse them.  It is armed with a steel spur as good as Master Land's<br>
        harpoon, I imagine."<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian did not put himself out enough to shrug his shoulders.<br>
        Attack cetacea with blows of a spur!  Who had ever heard of such a<br>
        thing?<br>
        <br>
        "Wait, M. Aronnax," said Captain Nemo.  "We will show you something you<br>
        have never yet seen.  We have no pity for these ferocious creatures.<br>
        They are nothing but mouth and teeth."<br>
        <br>
        Mouth and teeth!  No one could better describe the macrocephalous<br>
        cachalot, which is sometimes more than seventy-five feet long.  Its<br>
        enormous head occupies one-third of its entire body.  Better armed than<br>
        the whale, whose upper jaw is furnished only with whalebone, it is<br>
        supplied with twenty-five large tusks, about eight inches long,<br>
        cylindrical and conical at the top, each weighing two pounds.  It is in<br>
        the upper part of this enormous head, in great cavities divided by<br>
        cartilages, that is to be found from six to eight hundred pounds of<br>
        that precious oil called spermaceti.  The cachalot is a disagreeable<br>
        creature, more tadpole than fish, according to Fredol's description.<br>
        It is badly formed, the whole of its left side being (if we may say<br>
        it), a "failure," and being only able to see with its right eye.  But<br>
        the formidable troop was nearing us.  They had seen the whales and were<br>
        preparing to attack them.  One could judge beforehand that the<br>
        cachalots would be victorious, not only because they were better built<br>
        for attack than their inoffensive adversaries, but also because they<br>
        could remain longer under water without coming to the surface.  There<br>
        was only just time to go to the help of the whales.  The Nautilus went<br>
        under water.  Conseil, Ned Land, and I took our places before the<br>
        window in the saloon, and Captain Nemo joined the pilot in his cage to<br>
        work his apparatus as an engine of destruction.  Soon I felt the<br>
        beatings of the screw quicken, and our speed increased.  The battle<br>
        between the cachalots and the whales had already begun when the<br>
        Nautilus arrived.  They did not at first show any fear at the sight of<br>
        this new monster joining in the conflict.  But they soon had to guard<br>
        against its blows.  What a battle!  The Nautilus was nothing but a<br>
        formidable harpoon, brandished by the hand of its Captain.  It hurled<br>
        itself against the fleshy mass, passing through from one part to the<br>
        other, leaving behind it two quivering halves of the animal.  It could<br>
        <a href=../site0/page0_2486.html>external_link2_text</a><br><br>
        not feel the formidable blows from their tails upon its sides, nor the<br>
        shock which it produced itself, much more.  One cachalot killed, it ran<br>
        at the next, tacked on the spot that it might not miss its prey, going<br>
        forwards and backwards, answering to its helm, plunging when the<br>
        cetacean dived into the deep waters, coming up with it when it returned<br>
        to the surface, striking it front or sideways, cutting or tearing in<br>
        all directions and at any pace, piercing it with its terrible spur.<br>
        What carnage!  What a noise on the surface of the waves!  What sharp<br>
        hissing, and what snorting peculiar to these enraged animals!  In the<br>
        midst of these waters, generally so peaceful, their tails made perfect<br>
        billows.  For one hour this wholesale massacre continued, from which<br>
        the cachalots could not escape.  Several times ten or twelve united<br>
        tried to crush the Nautilus by their weight.  From the window we could<br>
        see their enormous mouths, studded with tusks, and their formidable<br>
        eyes.  Ned Land could not contain himself; he threatened and swore at<br>
        them.  We could feel them clinging to our vessel like dogs worrying a<br>
        wild boar in a copse.  But the Nautilus, working its screw, carried<br>
        them here and there, or to the upper levels of the ocean, without<br>
        caring for their enormous weight, nor the powerful strain on the<br>
        vessel.  At length the mass of cachalots broke up, the waves became<br>
        quiet, and I felt that we were rising to the surface.  The panel<br>
        opened, and we hurried on to the platform.  The sea was covered with<br>
        mutilated bodies.  A formidable explosion could not have divided and<br>
        torn this fleshy mass with more violence.  We were floating amid<br>
        gigantic bodies, bluish on the back and white underneath, covered with<br>
        enormous protuberances.  Some terrified cachalots were flying towards<br>
        the horizon.  The waves were dyed red for several miles, and the<br>
        Nautilus floated in a sea of blood:  Captain Nemo joined us.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Master Land?" said he.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, sir," replied the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had somewhat<br>
        calmed; "it is a terrible spectacle, certainly.  But I am not a<br>
        butcher.  I am a hunter, and I call this a butchery."<br>
        <br>
        "It is a massacre of mischievous creatures," replied the Captain; "and<br>
        the Nautilus is not a butcher's knife."<br>
        <br>
        "I like my harpoon better," said the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Every one to his own," answered the Captain, looking fixedly at Ned<br>
        Land.<br>
        <br>
        I feared he would commit some act of violence, which would end in sad<br>
        consequences.  But his anger was turned by the sight of a whale which<br>
        the Nautilus had just come up with.  The creature had not quite escaped<br>
        from the cachalot's teeth.  I recognised the southern whale by its flat<br>
        head, which is entirely black.  Anatomically, it is distinguished from<br>
        the white whale and the North Cape whale by the seven cervical<br>
        vertebrae, and it has two more ribs than its congeners.  The<br>
        unfortunate cetacean was lying on its side, riddled with holes from the<br>
        bites, and quite dead.  From its mutilated fin still hung a young whale<br>
        which it could not save from the massacre.  Its open mouth let the<br>
        water flow in and out, murmuring like the waves breaking on the shore.<br>
        Captain Nemo steered close to the corpse of the creature.  Two of his<br>
        men mounted its side, and I saw, not without surprise, that they were<br>
        drawing from its breasts all the milk which they contained, that is to<br>
        say, about two or three tons.  The Captain offered me a cup of the<br>
        milk, which was still warm.  I could not help showing my repugnance to<br>
        the drink; but he assured me that it was excellent, and not to be<br>
        distinguished from cow's milk.  I tasted it, and was of his opinion.<br>
        It was a useful reserve to us, for in the shape of salt butter or<br>
        cheese it would form an agreeable variety from our ordinary food.  From<br>
        that day I noticed with uneasiness that Ned Land's ill-will towards<br>
        Captain Nemo increased, and I resolved to watch the Canadian's gestures<br>
        closely.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XIII<br>
        <br>
        THE ICEBERG<br>
        <br>
        The Nautilus was steadily pursuing its southerly course, following the<br>
        fiftieth meridian with considerable speed.  Did he wish to reach the<br>
        pole?  I did not think so, for every attempt to reach that point had<br>
        hitherto failed.  Again, the season was far advanced, for in the<br>
        Antarctic regions the 13th of March corresponds with the 13th of<br>
        September of northern regions, which begin at the equinoctial season.<br>
        On the 14th of March I saw floating ice in latitude 55°, merely<br>
        pale bits of debris from twenty to twenty-five feet long, forming banks<br>
        over which the sea curled.  The Nautilus remained on the surface of the<br>
        ocean.  Ned Land, who had fished in the Arctic Seas, was familiar with<br>
        its icebergs; but Conseil and I admired them for the first time.  In<br>
        the atmosphere towards the southern horizon stretched a white dazzling<br>
        band.  English whalers have given it the name of "ice blink."  However<br>
        thick the clouds may be, it is always visible, and announces the<br>
        presence of an ice pack or bank.  Accordingly, larger blocks soon<br>
        appeared, whose brilliancy changed with the caprices of the fog.  Some<br>
        of these masses showed green veins, as if long undulating lines had<br>
        been traced with sulphate of copper; others resembled enormous<br>
        amethysts with the light shining through them.  Some reflected the<br>
        light of day upon a thousand crystal facets.  Others shaded with vivid<br>
        calcareous reflections resembled a perfect town of marble.  The more we<br>
        neared the south the more these floating islands increased both in<br>
        number and importance.<br>
        <br>
        At 60° lat. every pass had disappeared.  But, seeking carefully,<br>
        Captain Nemo soon found a narrow opening, through which he boldly<br>
        slipped, knowing, however, that it would close behind him.  Thus,<br>
        guided by this clever hand, the Nautilus passed through all the ice<br>
        with a precision which quite charmed Conseil; icebergs or mountains,<br>
        ice-fields or smooth plains, seeming to have no limits, drift-ice or<br>
        floating ice-packs, plains broken up, called palchs when they are<br>
        circular, and streams when they are made up of long strips.  The<br>
        temperature was very low; the thermometer exposed to the air marked 2<br>
        deg. or 3° below zero, but we were warmly clad with fur, at the<br>
        expense of the sea-bear and seal.  The interior of the Nautilus, warmed<br>
        regularly by its electric apparatus, defied the most intense cold.<br>
        Besides, it would only have been necessary to go some yards beneath the<br>
        waves to find a more bearable temperature.  Two months earlier we<br>
        should have had perpetual daylight in these latitudes; but already we<br>
        had had three or four hours of night, and by and by there would be six<br>
        months of darkness in these circumpolar regions.  On the 15th of March<br>
        we were in the latitude of New Shetland and South Orkney.  The Captain<br>
        told me that formerly numerous tribes of seals inhabited them; but that<br>
        English and American whalers, in their rage for destruction, massacred<br>
        both old and young; thus, where there was once life and animation, they<br>
        had left silence and death.<br>
        <br>
        About eight o'clock on the morning of the 16th of March the Nautilus,<br>
        following the fifty-fifth meridian, cut the Antarctic polar circle.<br>
        Ice surrounded us on all sides, and closed the horizon.  But Captain<br>
        Nemo went from one opening to another, still going higher.  I cannot<br>
        express my astonishment at the beauties of these new regions.  The ice<br>
        took most surprising forms.  Here the grouping formed an oriental town,<br>
        with innumerable mosques and minarets; there a fallen city thrown to<br>
        the earth, as it were, by some convulsion of nature.  The whole aspect<br>
        was constantly changed by the oblique rays of the sun, or lost in the<br>
        greyish fog amidst hurricanes of snow.  Detonations and falls were<br>
        heard on all sides, great overthrows of icebergs, which altered the<br>
        whole landscape like a diorama.  Often seeing no exit, I thought we<br>
        were definitely prisoners; but, instinct guiding him at the slightest<br>
        indication, Captain Nemo would discover a new pass.  He was never<br>
        mistaken when he saw the thin threads of bluish water trickling along<br>
        the ice-fields; and I had no doubt that he had already ventured into<br>
        the midst of these Antarctic seas before.  On the 16th of March,<br>
        however, the ice-fields absolutely blocked our road.  It was not the<br>
        iceberg itself, as yet, but vast fields cemented by the cold.  But this<br>
        obstacle could not stop Captain Nemo: he hurled himself against it with<br>
        frightful violence.  The Nautilus entered the brittle mass like a<br>
        wedge, and split it with frightful crackings.  It was the battering ram<br>
        of the ancients hurled by infinite strength.  The ice, thrown high in<br>
        the air, fell like hail around us.  By its own power of impulsion our<br>
        apparatus made a canal for itself; some times carried away by its own<br>
        impetus, it lodged on the ice-field, crushing it with its weight, and<br>
        sometimes buried beneath it, dividing it by a simple pitching movement,<br>
        producing large rents in it.  Violent gales assailed us at this time,<br>
        accompanied by thick fogs, through which, from one end of the platform<br>
        to the other, we could see nothing.  The wind blew sharply from all<br>
        parts of the compass, and the snow lay in such hard heaps that we had<br>
        to break it with blows of a pickaxe.  The temperature was always at 5<br>
        deg. below zero; every outward part of the Nautilus was covered with<br>
        ice.  A rigged vessel would have been entangled in the blocked up<br>
        gorges.  A vessel without sails, with electricity for its motive power,<br>
        and wanting no coal, could alone brave such high latitudes.  At length,<br>
        on the 18th of March, after many useless assaults, the Nautilus was<br>
        positively blocked.  It was no longer either streams, packs, or<br>
        ice-fields, but an interminable and immovable barrier, formed by<br>
        mountains soldered together.<br>
        <br>
        "An iceberg!" said the Canadian to me.<br>
        <br>
        I knew that to Ned Land, as well as to all other navigators who had<br>
        preceded us, this was an inevitable obstacle.  The sun appearing for an<br>
        instant at noon, Captain Nemo took an observation as near as possible,<br>
        which gave our situation at 51° 30' long. and 67° 39' of S.<br>
        lat.  We had advanced one degree more in this Antarctic region.  Of the<br>
        liquid surface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse.  Under the<br>
        spur of the Nautilus lay stretched a vast plain, entangled with<br>
        confused blocks.  Here and there sharp points and slender needles<br>
        rising to a height of 200 feet; further on a steep shore, hewn as it<br>
        were with an axe and clothed with greyish tints; huge mirrors,<br>
        reflecting a few rays of sunshine, half drowned in the fog.  And over<br>
        this desolate face of nature a stern silence reigned, scarcely broken<br>
        by the flapping of the wings of petrels and puffins.  Everything was<br>
        frozen--even the noise.  The Nautilus was then obliged to stop in its<br>
        adventurous course amid these fields of ice.  In spite of our efforts,<br>
        in spite of the powerful means employed to break up the ice, the<br>
        Nautilus remained immovable.  Generally, when we can proceed no<br>
        further, we have return still open to us; but here return was as<br>
        impossible as advance, for every pass had closed behind us; and for the<br>
        few moments when we were stationary, we were likely to be entirely<br>
        blocked, which did indeed happen about two o'clock in the afternoon,<br>
        the fresh ice forming around its sides with astonishing rapidity.  I<br>
        was obliged to admit that Captain Nemo was more than imprudent.  I was<br>
        on the platform at that moment.  The Captain had been observing our<br>
        situation for some time past, when he said to me:<br>
        <br>
        "Well, sir, what do you think of this?"<br>
        <br>
        "I think that we are caught, Captain."<br>
        <br>
        "So, M. Aronnax, you really think that the Nautilus cannot disengage<br>
        itself?"<br>
        <br>
        "With difficulty, Captain; for the season is already too far advanced<br>
        for you to reckon on the breaking of the ice."<br>
        <br>
        "Ah! sir," said Captain Nemo, in an ironical tone, "you will always be<br>
        the same.  You see nothing but difficulties and obstacles.  I affirm<br>
        that not only can the Nautilus disengage itself, but also that it can<br>
        go further still."<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site3/page3_8805.html>external_link3_text</a><br><br>
        "Further to the South?"  I asked, looking at the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir; it shall go to the pole."<br>
        <br>
        "To the pole!"  I exclaimed, unable to repress a gesture of incredulity.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," replied the Captain, coldly, "to the Antarctic pole--to that<br>
        unknown point from whence springs every meridian of the globe.  You<br>
        know whether I can do as I please with the Nautilus!"<br>
        <br>
        Yes, I knew that.  I knew that this man was bold, even to rashness.<br>
        But to conquer those obstacles which bristled round the South Pole,<br>
        rendering it more inaccessible than the North, which had not yet been<br>
        reached by the boldest navigators--was it not a mad enterprise, one<br>
        which only a maniac would have conceived?  It then came into my head to<br>
        ask Captain Nemo if he had ever discovered that pole which had never<br>
        yet been trodden by a human creature?<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir," he replied; "but we will discover it together.  Where others<br>
        have failed, I will not fail.  I have never yet led my Nautilus so far<br>
        into southern seas; but, I repeat, it shall go further yet."<br>
        <br>
        "I can well believe you, Captain," said I, in a slightly ironical tone.<br>
        "I believe you!  Let us go ahead!  There are no obstacles for us!  Let<br>
        us smash this iceberg!  Let us blow it up; and, if it resists, let us<br>
        give the Nautilus wings to fly over it!"<br>
        <br>
        "Over it, sir!" said Captain Nemo, quietly; "no, not over it, but under<br>
        it!"<br>
        <br>
        "Under it!"  I exclaimed, a sudden idea of the Captain's projects<br>
        flashing upon my mind.  I understood; the wonderful qualities of the<br>
        Nautilus were going to serve us in this superhuman enterprise.<br>
        <br>
        "I see we are beginning to understand one another, sir," said the<br>
        Captain, half smiling.  "You begin to see the possibility--I should say<br>
        the success--of this attempt.  That which is impossible for an ordinary<br>
        vessel is easy to the Nautilus.  If a continent lies before the pole,<br>
        it must stop before the continent; but if, on the contrary, the pole is<br>
        washed by open sea, it will go even to the pole."<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly," said I, carried away by the Captain's reasoning; "if the<br>
        surface of the sea is solidified by the ice, the lower depths are free<br>
        by the Providential law which has placed the maximum of density of the<br>
        waters of the ocean one degree higher than freezing-point; and, if I am<br>
        not mistaken, the portion of this iceberg which is above the water is<br>
        as one to four to that which is below."<br>
        <br>
        "Very nearly, sir; for one foot of iceberg above the sea there are<br>
        three below it.  If these ice mountains are not more than 300 feet<br>
        above the surface, they are not more than 900 beneath.  And what are<br>
        900 feet to the Nautilus?"<br>
        <br>
        "Nothing, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "It could even seek at greater depths that uniform temperature of<br>
        sea-water, and there brave with impunity the thirty or forty degrees of<br>
        surface cold."<br>
        <br>
        "Just so, sir--just so," I replied, getting animated.<br>
        <br>
        "The only difficulty," continued Captain Nemo, "is that of remaining<br>
        several days without renewing our provision of air."<br>
        <br>
        "Is that all?  The Nautilus has vast reservoirs; we can fill them, and<br>
        they will supply us with all the oxygen we want."<br>
        <br>
        "Well thought of, M. Aronnax," replied the Captain, smiling.  "But, not<br>
        wishing you to accuse me of rashness, I will first give you all my<br>
        objections."<br>
        <br>
        "Have you any more to make?"<br>
        <br>
        "Only one.  It is possible, if the sea exists at the South Pole, that<br>
        it may be covered; and, consequently, we shall be unable to come to the<br>
        surface."<br>
        <br>
        "Good, sir! but do you forget that the Nautilus is armed with a<br>
        powerful spur, and could we not send it diagonally against these fields<br>
        of ice, which would open at the shocks."<br>
        <br>
        "Ah! sir, you are full of ideas to-day."<br>
        <br>
        "Besides, Captain," I added, enthusiastically, "why should we not find<br>
        the sea open at the South Pole as well as at the North?  The frozen<br>
        poles of the earth do not coincide, either in the southern or in the<br>
        northern regions; and, until it is proved to the contrary, we may<br>
        suppose either a continent or an ocean free from ice at these two<br>
        points of the globe."<br>
        <br>
        "I think so too, M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo.  "I only wish you<br>
        to observe that, after having made so many objections to my project,<br>
        you are now crushing me with arguments in its favour!"<br>
        <br>
        The preparations for this audacious attempt now began.  The powerful<br>
        pumps of the Nautilus were working air into the reservoirs and storing<br>
        it at high pressure.  About four o'clock, Captain Nemo announced the<br>
        closing of the panels on the platform.  I threw one last look at the<br>
        massive iceberg which we were going to cross.  The weather was clear,<br>
        the atmosphere pure enough, the cold very great, being 12° below<br>
        zero; but, the wind having gone down, this temperature was not so<br>
        unbearable.  About ten men mounted the sides of the Nautilus, armed<br>
        with pickaxes to break the ice around the vessel, which was soon free.<br>
        The operation was quickly performed, for the fresh ice was still very<br>
        thin.  We all went below.  The usual reservoirs were filled with the<br>
        newly-liberated water, and the Nautilus soon descended.  I had taken my<br>
        place with Conseil in the saloon; through the open window we could see<br>
        the lower beds of the Southern Ocean.  The thermometer went up, the<br>
        needle of the compass deviated on the dial.  At about 900 feet, as<br>
        Captain Nemo had foreseen, we were floating beneath the undulating<br>
        bottom of the iceberg.  But the Nautilus went lower still--it went to<br>
        the depth of four hundred fathoms.  The temperature of the water at the<br>
        surface showed twelve degrees, it was now only ten; we had gained two.<br>
        I need not say the temperature of the Nautilus was raised by its<br>
        heating apparatus to a much higher degree; every manoeuvre was<br>
        accomplished with wonderful precision.<br>
        <br>
        "We shall pass it, if you please, sir," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "I believe we shall," I said, in a tone of firm conviction.<br>
        <br>
        In this open sea, the Nautilus had taken its course direct to the pole,<br>
        without leaving the fifty-second meridian.  From 67° 30' to 90<br>
        deg., twenty-two degrees and a half of latitude remained to travel;<br>
        that is, about five hundred leagues.  The Nautilus kept up a mean speed<br>
        of twenty-six miles an hour--the speed of an express train.  If that<br>
        was kept up, in forty hours we should reach the pole.<br>
        <br>
        For a part of the night the novelty of the situation kept us at the<br>
        window.  The sea was lit with the electric lantern; but it was<br>
        deserted; fishes did not sojourn in these imprisoned waters; they only<br>
        found there a passage to take them from the Antarctic Ocean to the open<br>
        polar sea.  Our pace was rapid; we could feel it by the quivering of<br>
        the long steel body.  About two in the morning I took some hours'<br>
        repose, and Conseil did the same.  In crossing the waist I did not meet<br>
        Captain Nemo: I supposed him to be in the pilot's cage.  The next<br>
        morning, the 19th of March, I took my post once more in the saloon.<br>
        The electric log told me that the speed of the Nautilus had been<br>
        slackened.  It was then going towards the surface; but prudently<br>
        emptying its reservoirs very slowly.  My heart beat fast.  Were we<br>
        going to emerge and regain the open polar atmosphere?  No!  A shock<br>
        told me that the Nautilus had struck the bottom of the iceberg, still<br>
        very thick, judging from the deadened sound.  We had in deed "struck,"<br>
        to use a sea expression, but in an inverse sense, and at a thousand<br>
        feet deep.  This would give three thousand feet of ice above us; one<br>
        thousand being above the water-mark. The iceberg was then higher than<br>
        at its borders--not a very reassuring fact.  Several times that day the<br>
        Nautilus tried again, and every time it struck the wall which lay like<br>
        a ceiling above it.  Sometimes it met with but 900 yards, only 200 of<br>
        which rose above the surface.  It was twice the height it was when the<br>
        Nautilus had gone under the waves.  I carefully noted the different<br>
        depths, and thus obtained a submarine profile of the chain as it was<br>
        developed under the water.  That night no change had taken place in our<br>
        situation.  Still ice between four and five hundred yards in depth!  It<br>
        was evidently diminishing, but, still, what a thickness between us and<br>
        the surface of the ocean!  It was then eight.  According to the daily<br>
        custom on board the Nautilus, its air should have been renewed four<br>
        hours ago; but I did not suffer much, although Captain Nemo had not yet<br>
        made any demand upon his reserve of oxygen.  My sleep was painful that<br>
        night; hope and fear besieged me by turns: I rose several times.  The<br>
        groping of the Nautilus continued.  About three in the morning, I<br>
        noticed that the lower surface of the iceberg was only about fifty feet<br>
        deep.  One hundred and fifty feet now separated us from the surface of<br>
        the waters.  The iceberg was by degrees becoming an ice-field, the<br>
        mountain a plain.  My eyes never left the manometer.  We were still<br>
        rising diagonally to the surface, which sparkled under the electric<br>
        rays.  The iceberg was stretching both above and beneath into<br>
        lengthening slopes; mile after mile it was getting thinner.  At length,<br>
        at six in the morning of that memorable day, the 19th of March, the<br>
        door of the saloon opened, and Captain Nemo appeared.<br>
        <br>
        "The sea is open!!" was all he said.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XIV<br>
        <br>
        THE SOUTH POLE<br>
        <br>
        I rushed on to the platform.  Yes! the open sea, with but a few<br>
        scattered pieces of ice and moving icebergs--a long stretch of sea; a<br>
        world of birds in the air, and myriads of fishes under those waters,<br>
        which varied from intense blue to olive green, according to the bottom.<br>
        The thermometer marked 3° C. above zero.  It was comparatively<br>
        spring, shut up as we were behind this iceberg, whose lengthened mass<br>
        was dimly seen on our northern horizon.<br>
        <br>
        "Are we at the pole?"  I asked the Captain, with a beating heart.<br>
        <br>
        "I do not know," he replied.  "At noon I will take our bearings."<br>
        <br>
        "But will the sun show himself through this fog?" said I, looking at<br>
        the leaden sky.<br>
        <br>
        "However little it shows, it will be enough," replied the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        About ten miles south a solitary island rose to a height of one hundred<br>
        and four yards.  We made for it, but carefully, for the sea might be<br>
        strewn with banks.  One hour afterwards we had reached it, two hours<br>
        later we had made the round of it.  It measured four or five miles in<br>
        circumference.  A narrow canal separated it from a considerable stretch<br>
        of land, perhaps a continent, for we could not see its limits.  The<br>
        existence of this land seemed to give some colour to Maury's theory.<br>
        The ingenious American has remarked that, between the South Pole and<br>
        <a href=../site2/page2_2475.html>internal_link4_text</a><br><br>
        the sixtieth parallel, the sea is covered with floating ice of enormous<br>
        size, which is never met with in the North Atlantic.  From this fact he<br>
        has drawn the conclusion that the Antarctic Circle encloses<br>
        considerable continents, as icebergs cannot form in open sea, but only<br>
        on the coasts.  According to these calculations, the mass of ice<br>
        surrounding the southern pole forms a vast cap, the circumference of<br>
        which must be, at least, 2,500 miles.  But the Nautilus, for fear of<br>
        running aground, had stopped about three cable-lengths from a strand<br>
        over which reared a superb heap of rocks.  The boat was launched; the<br>
        Captain, two of his men, bearing instruments, Conseil, and myself were<br>
        in it.  It was ten in the morning.  I had not seen Ned Land.  Doubtless<br>
        the Canadian did not wish to admit the presence of the South Pole.  A<br>
        few strokes of the oar brought us to the sand, where we ran ashore.<br>
        Conseil was going to jump on to the land, when I held him back.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said I to Captain Nemo, "to you belongs the honour of first<br>
        setting foot on this land."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir," said the Captain, "and if I do not hesitate to tread this<br>
        South Pole, it is because, up to this time, no human being has left a<br>
        trace there."<br>
        <br>
        Saying this, he jumped lightly on to the sand.  His heart beat with<br>
        emotion.  He climbed a rock, sloping to a little promontory, and there,<br>
        with his arms crossed, mute and motionless, and with an eager look, he<br>
        seemed to take possession of these southern regions.  After five<br>
        minutes passed in this ecstasy, he turned to us.<br>
        <br>
        "When you like, sir."<br>
        <br>
        I landed, followed by Conseil, leaving the two men in the boat.  For a<br>
        long way the soil was composed of a reddish sandy stone, something like<br>
        crushed brick, scoriae, streams of lava, and pumice-stones. One could<br>
        not mistake its volcanic origin.  In some parts, slight curls of smoke<br>
        emitted a sulphurous smell, proving that the internal fires had lost<br>
        nothing of their expansive powers, though, having climbed a high<br>
        acclivity, I could see no volcano for a radius of several miles.  We<br>
        know that in those Antarctic countries, James Ross found two craters,<br>
        the Erebus and Terror, in full activity, on the 167th meridian,<br>
        latitude 77° 32'. The vegetation of this desolate continent seemed<br>
        to me much restricted.  Some lichens lay upon the black rocks; some<br>
        microscopic plants, rudimentary diatomas, a kind of cells placed<br>
        between two quartz shells; long purple and scarlet weed, supported on<br>
        little swimming bladders, which the breaking of the waves brought to<br>
        the shore.  These constituted the meagre flora of this region.  The<br>
        shore was strewn with molluscs, little mussels, and limpets.  I also<br>
        saw myriads of northern clios, one-and-a-quarter inches long, of which<br>
        a whale would swallow a whole world at a mouthful; and some perfect<br>
        sea-butterflies, animating the waters on the skirts of the shore.<br>
        <br>
        There appeared on the high bottoms some coral shrubs, of the kind<br>
        which, according to James Ross, live in the Antarctic seas to the depth<br>
        of more than 1,000 yards.  Then there were little kingfishers and<br>
        starfish studding the soil.  But where life abounded most was in the<br>
        air.  There thousands of birds fluttered and flew of all kinds,<br>
        deafening us with their cries; others crowded the rock, looking at us<br>
        as we passed by without fear, and pressing familiarly close by our<br>
        feet.  There were penguins, so agile in the water, heavy and awkward as<br>
        they are on the ground; they were uttering harsh cries, a large<br>
        assembly, sober in gesture, but extravagant in clamour.  Albatrosses<br>
        passed in the air, the expanse of their wings being at least four yards<br>
        and a half, and justly called the vultures of the ocean; some gigantic<br>
        petrels, and some damiers, a kind of small duck, the underpart of whose<br>
        body is black and white; then there were a whole series of petrels,<br>
        some whitish, with brown-bordered wings, others blue, peculiar to the<br>
        Antarctic seas, and so oily, as I told Conseil, that the inhabitants of<br>
        the Ferroe Islands had nothing to do before lighting them but to put a<br>
        wick in.<br>
        <br>
        "A little more," said Conseil, "and they would be perfect lamps!  After<br>
        that, we cannot expect Nature to have previously furnished them with<br>
        wicks!"<br>
        <br>
        About half a mile farther on the soil was riddled with ruffs' nests, a<br>
        sort of laying-ground, out of which many birds were issuing.  Captain<br>
        Nemo had some hundreds hunted.  They uttered a cry like the braying of<br>
        an ass, were about the size of a goose, slate-colour on the body, white<br>
        beneath, with a yellow line round their throats; they allowed<br>
        themselves to be killed with a stone, never trying to escape.  But the<br>
        fog did not lift, and at eleven the sun had not yet shown itself.  Its<br>
        absence made me uneasy.  Without it no observations were possible.<br>
        How, then, could we decide whether we had reached the pole?  When I<br>
        rejoined Captain Nemo, I found him leaning on a piece of rock, silently<br>
        watching the sky.  He seemed impatient and vexed.  But what was to be<br>
        done?  This rash and powerful man could not command the sun as he did<br>
        the sea.  Noon arrived without the orb of day showing itself for an<br>
        instant.  We could not even tell its position behind the curtain of<br>
        fog; and soon the fog turned to snow.<br>
        <br>
        "Till to-morrow," said the Captain, quietly, and we returned to the<br>
        Nautilus amid these atmospheric disturbances.<br>
        <br>
        The tempest of snow continued till the next day.  It was impossible to<br>
        remain on the platform.  From the saloon, where I was taking notes of<br>
        incidents happening during this excursion to the polar continent, I<br>
        could hear the cries of petrels and albatrosses sporting in the midst<br>
        of this violent storm.  The Nautilus did not remain motionless, but<br>
        skirted the coast, advancing ten miles more to the south in the<br>
        half-light left by the sun as it skirted the edge of the horizon.  The<br>
        next day, the 20th of March, the snow had ceased.  The cold was a<br>
        little greater, the thermometer showing 2° below zero.  The fog<br>
        was rising, and I hoped that that day our observations might be taken.<br>
        Captain Nemo not having yet appeared, the boat took Conseil and myself<br>
        to land.  The soil was still of the same volcanic nature; everywhere<br>
        were traces of lava, scoriae, and basalt; but the crater which had<br>
        vomited them I could not see.  Here, as lower down, this continent was<br>
        alive with myriads of birds.  But their rule was now divided with large<br>
        troops of sea-mammals, looking at us with their soft eyes.  There were<br>
        several kinds of seals, some stretched on the earth, some on flakes of<br>
        ice, many going in and out of the sea.  They did not flee at our<br>
        approach, never having had anything to do with man; and I reckoned that<br>
        there were provisions there for hundreds of vessels.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said Conseil, "will you tell me the names of these creatures?"<br>
        <br>
        "They are seals and morses."<br>
        <br>
        It was now eight in the morning.  Four hours remained to us before the<br>
        sun could be observed with advantage.  I directed our steps towards a<br>
        vast bay cut in the steep granite shore.  There, I can aver that earth<br>
        and ice were lost to sight by the numbers of sea-mammals covering them,<br>
        and I involuntarily sought for old Proteus, the mythological shepherd<br>
        who watched these immense flocks of Neptune.  There were more seals<br>
        than anything else, forming distinct groups, male and female, the<br>
        father watching over his family, the mother suckling her little ones,<br>
        some already strong enough to go a few steps.  When they wished to<br>
        change their place, they took little jumps, made by the contraction of<br>
        their bodies, and helped awkwardly enough by their imperfect fin,<br>
        which, as with the lamantin, their cousins, forms a perfect forearm.  I<br>
        should say that, in the water, which is their element--the spine of<br>
        these creatures is flexible; with smooth and close skin and webbed<br>
        feet--they swim admirably.  In resting on the earth they take the most<br>
        graceful attitudes.  Thus the ancients, observing their soft and<br>
        expressive looks, which cannot be surpassed by the most beautiful look<br>
        a woman can give, their clear voluptuous eyes, their charming<br>
        positions, and the poetry of their manners, metamorphosed them, the<br>
        male into a triton and the female into a mermaid.  I made Conseil<br>
        notice the considerable development of the lobes of the brain in these<br>
        interesting cetaceans.  No mammal, except man, has such a quantity of<br>
        brain matter; they are also capable of receiving a certain amount of<br>
        education, are easily domesticated, and I think, with other<br>
        naturalists, that if properly taught they would be of great service as<br>
        fishing-dogs.  The greater part of them slept on the rocks or on the<br>
        sand.  Amongst these seals, properly so called, which have no external<br>
        ears (in which they differ from the otter, whose ears are prominent), I<br>
        noticed several varieties of seals about three yards long, with a white<br>
        coat, bulldog heads, armed with teeth in both jaws, four incisors at<br>
        the top and four at the bottom, and two large canine teeth in the shape<br>
        of a fleur-de-lis. Amongst them glided sea-elephants, a kind of seal,<br>
        with short, flexible trunks.  The giants of this species measured<br>
        twenty feet round and ten yards and a half in length; but they did not<br>
        move as we approached.<br>
        <br>
        "These creatures are not dangerous?" asked Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "No; not unless you attack them.  When they have to defend their young<br>
        their rage is terrible, and it is not uncommon for them to break the<br>
        fishing-boats to pieces."<br>
        <br>
        "They are quite right," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "I do not say they are not."<br>
        <br>
        Two miles farther on we were stopped by the promontory which shelters<br>
        the bay from the southerly winds.  Beyond it we heard loud bellowings<br>
        such as a troop of ruminants would produce.<br>
        <br>
        "Good!" said Conseil; "a concert of bulls!"<br>
        <br>
        "No; a concert of morses."<br>
        <br>
        "They are fighting!"<br>
        <br>
        "They are either fighting or playing."<br>
        <br>
        We now began to climb the blackish rocks, amid unforeseen stumbles, and<br>
        over stones which the ice made slippery.  More than once I rolled over<br>
        at the expense of my loins.  Conseil, more prudent or more steady, did<br>
        not stumble, and helped me up, saying:<br>
        <br>
        "If, sir, you would have the kindness to take wider steps, you would<br>
        preserve your equilibrium better."<br>
        <br>
        Arrived at the upper ridge of the promontory, I saw a vast white plain<br>
        covered with morses.  They were playing amongst themselves, and what we<br>
        heard were bellowings of pleasure, not of anger.<br>
        <br>
        As I passed these curious animals I could examine them leisurely, for<br>
        they did not move.  Their skins were thick and rugged, of a yellowish<br>
        tint, approaching to red; their hair was short and scant.  Some of them<br>
        were four yards and a quarter long.  Quieter and less timid than their<br>
        cousins of the north, they did not, like them, place sentinels round<br>
        the outskirts of their encampment.  After examining this city of<br>
        morses, I began to think of returning.  It was eleven o'clock, and, if<br>
        Captain Nemo found the conditions favourable for observations, I wished<br>
        to be present at the operation.  We followed a narrow pathway running<br>
        along the summit of the steep shore.  At half-past eleven we had<br>
        reached the place where we landed.  The boat had run aground, bringing<br>
        the Captain.  I saw him standing on a block of basalt, his instruments<br>
        near him, his eyes fixed on the northern horizon, near which the sun<br>
        was then describing a lengthened curve.  I took my place beside him,<br>
        and waited without speaking.  Noon arrived, and, as before, the sun did<br>
        not appear.  It was a fatality.  Observations were still wanting.  If<br>
        not accomplished to-morrow, we must give up all idea of taking any.  We<br>
