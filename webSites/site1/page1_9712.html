        A WALK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA<br>
        <br>
        This cell was, to speak correctly, the arsenal and wardrobe of the<br>
        Nautilus.  A dozen diving apparatuses hung from the partition waiting<br>
        our use.<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land, on seeing them, showed evident repugnance to dress himself in<br>
        one.<br>
        <br>
        "But, my worthy Ned, the forests of the Island of Crespo are nothing<br>
        but submarine forests."<br>
        <br>
        "Good!" said the disappointed harpooner, who saw his dreams of fresh<br>
        meat fade away.  "And you, M. Aronnax, are you going to dress yourself<br>
        in those clothes?"<br>
        <br>
        "There is no alternative, Master Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "As you please, sir," replied the harpooner, shrugging his shoulders;<br>
        "but, as for me, unless I am forced, I will never get into one."<br>
        <br>
        "No one will force you, Master Ned," said Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "Is Conseil going to risk it?" asked Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "I follow my master wherever he goes," replied Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        At the Captain's call two of the ship's crew came to help us dress in<br>
        these heavy and impervious clothes, made of india-rubber without seam,<br>
        and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure.  One would<br>
        have thought it a suit of armour, both supple and resisting.  This suit<br>
        formed trousers and waistcoat.  The trousers were finished off with<br>
        thick boots, weighted with heavy leaden soles.  The texture of the<br>
        waistcoat was held together by bands of copper, which crossed the<br>
        chest, protecting it from the great pressure of the water, and leaving<br>
        the lungs free to act; the sleeves ended in gloves, which in no way<br>
        restrained the movement of the hands.  There was a vast difference<br>
        noticeable between these consummate apparatuses and the old cork<br>
        breastplates, jackets, and other contrivances in vogue during the<br>
        eighteenth century.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo and one of his companions (a sort of Hercules, who must<br>
        have possessed great strength), Conseil and myself were soon enveloped<br>
        in the dresses.  There remained nothing more to be done but to enclose<br>
        our heads in the metal box.  But, before proceeding to this operation,<br>
        I asked the Captain's permission to examine the guns.<br>
        <br>
        One of the Nautilus men gave me a simple gun, the butt end of which,<br>
        made of steel, hollow in the centre, was rather large.  It served as a<br>
        reservoir for compressed air, which a valve, worked by a spring,<br>
        allowed to escape into a metal tube.  A box of projectiles in a groove<br>
        in the thickness of the butt end contained about twenty of these<br>
        electric balls, which, by means of a spring, were forced into the<br>
        barrel of the gun.  As soon as one shot was fired, another was ready.<br>
        <br>
        "Captain Nemo," said I, "this arm is perfect, and easily handled: I<br>
        only ask to be allowed to try it.  But how shall we gain the bottom of<br>
        the sea?"<br>
        <br>
        "At this moment, Professor, the Nautilus is stranded in five fathoms,<br>
        and we have nothing to do but to start."<br>
        <br>
        "But how shall we get off?"<br>
        <br>
        "You shall see."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo thrust his head into the helmet, Conseil and I did the<br>
        same, not without hearing an ironical "Good sport!" from the Canadian.<br>
        The upper part of our dress terminated in a copper collar upon which<br>
        was screwed the metal helmet.  Three holes, protected by thick glass,<br>
        allowed us to see in all directions, by simply turning our head in the<br>
        interior of the head-dress. As soon as it was in position, the<br>
        Rouquayrol apparatus on our backs began to act; and, for my part, I<br>
        could breathe with ease.<br>
        <br>
        With the Ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt, and the gun in my hand, I<br>
        was ready to set out.  But to speak the truth, imprisoned in these<br>
        heavy garments, and glued to the deck by my leaden soles, it was<br>
        impossible for me to take a step.<br>
        <br>
        But this state of things was provided for.  I felt myself being pushed<br>
        into a little room contiguous to the wardrobe room.  My companions<br>
        followed, towed along in the same way.  I heard a water-tight door,<br>
        furnished with stopper plates, close upon us, and we were wrapped in<br>
        profound darkness.<br>
        <br>
        After some minutes, a loud hissing was heard.  I felt the cold mount<br>
        from my feet to my chest.  Evidently from some part of the vessel they<br>
        had, by means of a tap, given entrance to the water, which was invading<br>
        us, and with which the room was soon filled.  A second door cut in the<br>
        side of the Nautilus then opened.  We saw a faint light.  In another<br>
        instant our feet trod the bottom of the sea.<br>
        <br>
        And now, how can I retrace the impression left upon me by that walk<br>
        under the waters?  Words are impotent to relate such wonders!  Captain<br>
        Nemo walked in front, his companion followed some steps behind.<br>
        Conseil and I remained near each other, as if an exchange of words had<br>
        been possible through our metallic cases.  I no longer felt the weight<br>
        of my clothing, or of my shoes, of my reservoir of air, or my thick<br>
        helmet, in the midst of which my head rattled like an almond in its<br>
        shell.<br>
        <br>
        The light, which lit the soil thirty feet below the surface of the<br>
        ocean, astonished me by its power.  The solar rays shone through the<br>
        watery mass easily, and dissipated all colour, and I clearly<br>
        distinguished objects at a distance of a hundred and fifty yards.<br>
        Beyond that the tints darkened into fine gradations of ultramarine, and<br>
        faded into vague obscurity.  Truly this water which surrounded me was<br>
        but another air denser than the terrestrial atmosphere, but almost as<br>
        transparent.  Above me was the calm surface of the sea.  We were<br>
        walking on fine, even sand, not wrinkled, as on a flat shore, which<br>
        retains the impression of the billows.  This dazzling carpet, really a<br>
        reflector, repelled the rays of the sun with wonderful intensity, which<br>
        accounted for the vibration which penetrated every atom of liquid.<br>
        Shall I be believed when I say that, at the depth of thirty feet, I<br>
        could see as if I was in broad daylight?<br>
        <br>
        For a quarter of an hour I trod on this sand, sown with the impalpable<br>
        dust of shells.  The hull of the Nautilus, resembling a long shoal,<br>
        disappeared by degrees; but its lantern, when darkness should overtake<br>
        us in the waters, would help to guide us on board by its distinct rays.<br>
        <br>
        Soon forms of objects outlined in the distance were discernible.  I<br>
        recognised magnificent rocks, hung with a tapestry of zoophytes of the<br>
        most beautiful kind, and I was at first struck by the peculiar effect<br>
        of this medium.<br>
        <br>
        It was then ten in the morning; the rays of the sun struck the surface<br>
        of the waves at rather an oblique angle, and at the touch of their<br>
        light, decomposed by refraction as through a prism, flowers, rocks,<br>
        plants, shells, and polypi were shaded at the edges by the seven solar<br>
        colours.  It was marvellous, a feast for the eyes, this complication of<br>
        coloured tints, a perfect kaleidoscope of green, yellow, orange,<br>
        violet, indigo, and blue; in one word, the whole palette of an<br>
        enthusiastic colourist!  Why could I not communicate to Conseil the<br>
        lively sensations which were mounting to my brain, and rival him in<br>
        expressions of admiration?  For aught I knew, Captain Nemo and his<br>
        companion might be able to exchange thoughts by means of signs<br>
        previously agreed upon.  So, for want of better, I talked to myself; I<br>
        declaimed in the copper box which covered my head, thereby expending<br>
        more air in vain words than was perhaps wise.<br>
        <br>
        Various kinds of isis, clusters of pure tuft-coral, prickly fungi, and<br>
        anemones formed a brilliant garden of flowers, decked with their<br>
        collarettes of blue tentacles, sea-stars studding the sandy bottom.  It<br>
        was a real grief to me to crush under my feet the brilliant specimens<br>
        of molluscs which strewed the ground by thousands, of hammerheads,<br>
        donaciae (veritable bounding shells), of staircases, and red<br>
        helmet-shells, angel-wings, and many others produced by this<br>
        inexhaustible ocean.  But we were bound to walk, so we went on, whilst<br>
        above our heads waved medusae whose umbrellas of opal or rose-pink,<br>
        escalloped with a band of blue, sheltered us from the rays of the sun<br>
        and fiery pelagiae, which, in the darkness, would have strewn our path<br>
        with phosphorescent light.<br>
        <br>
        All these wonders I saw in the space of a quarter of a mile, scarcely<br>
        stopping, and following Captain Nemo, who beckoned me on by signs.<br>
        Soon the nature of the soil changed; to the sandy plain succeeded an<br>
        extent of slimy mud which the Americans call "ooze," composed of equal<br>
        parts of silicious and calcareous shells.  We then travelled over a<br>
        plain of seaweed of wild and luxuriant vegetation.  This sward was of<br>
        close texture, and soft to the feet, and rivalled the softest carpet<br>
        woven by the hand of man.  But whilst verdure was spread at our feet,<br>
        it did not abandon our heads.  A light network of marine plants, of<br>
        that inexhaustible family of seaweeds of which more than two thousand<br>
        kinds are known, grew on the surface of the water.<br>
        <br>
        I noticed that the green plants kept nearer the top of the sea, whilst<br>
        the red were at a greater depth, leaving to the black or brown the care<br>
        of forming gardens and parterres in the remote beds of the ocean.<br>
        <br>
        We had quitted the Nautilus about an hour and a half.  It was near<br>
        noon; I knew by the perpendicularity of the sun's rays, which were no<br>
        longer refracted.  The magical colours disappeared by degrees, and the<br>
        shades of emerald and sapphire were effaced.  We walked with a regular<br>
        step, which rang upon the ground with astonishing intensity; the<br>
        slightest noise was transmitted with a quickness to which the ear is<br>
        unaccustomed on the earth; indeed, water is a better conductor of sound<br>
        than air, in the ratio of four to one.  At this period the earth sloped<br>
        downwards; the light took a uniform tint.  We were at a depth of a<br>
        hundred and five yards and twenty inches, undergoing a pressure of six<br>
        atmospheres.<br>
        <br>
        At this depth I could still see the rays of the sun, though feebly; to<br>
        their intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight, the lowest<br>
        state between day and night; but we could still see well enough; it was<br>
        not necessary to resort to the Ruhmkorff apparatus as yet.  At this<br>
        moment Captain Nemo stopped; he waited till I joined him, and then<br>
        pointed to an obscure mass, looming in the shadow, at a short distance.<br>
        <br>
        "It is the forest of the Island of Crespo," thought I; and I was not<br>
        mistaken.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XVI<br>
        <br>
        A SUBMARINE FOREST<br>
        <br>
        We had at last arrived on the borders of this forest, doubtless one of<br>
        the finest of Captain Nemo's immense domains.  He looked upon it as his<br>
        own, and considered he had the same right over it that the first men<br>
        had in the first days of the world.  And, indeed, who would have<br>
        disputed with him the possession of this submarine property?  What<br>
        other hardier pioneer would come, hatchet in hand, to cut down the dark<br>
        copses?<br>
        <br>
        This forest was composed of large tree-plants; and the moment we<br>
        penetrated under its vast arcades, I was struck by the singular<br>
        position of their branches--a position I had not yet observed.<br>
        <br>
        Not an herb which carpeted the ground, not a branch which clothed the<br>
        trees, was either broken or bent, nor did they extend horizontally; all<br>
        stretched up to the surface of the ocean.  Not a filament, not a<br>
        ribbon, however thin they might be, but kept as straight as a rod of<br>
        iron.  The fuci and llianas grew in rigid perpendicular lines, due to<br>
        the density of the element which had produced them.  Motionless yet,<br>
        when bent to one side by the hand, they directly resumed their former<br>
        position.  Truly it was the region of perpendicularity!<br>
        <br>
        I soon accustomed myself to this fantastic position, as well as to the<br>
        comparative darkness which surrounded us.  The soil of the forest<br>
        seemed covered with sharp blocks, difficult to avoid.  The submarine<br>
        flora struck me as being very perfect, and richer even than it would<br>
        have been in the arctic or tropical zones, where these productions are<br>
        not so plentiful.  But for some minutes I involuntarily confounded the<br>
        genera, taking animals for plants; and who would not have been<br>
        mistaken?  The fauna and the flora are too closely allied in this<br>
        submarine world.<br>
        <br>
        These plants are self-propagated, and the principle of their existence<br>
        is in the water, which upholds and nourishes them.  The greater number,<br>
        instead of leaves, shoot forth blades of capricious shapes, comprised<br>
        within a scale of colours pink, carmine, green, olive, fawn, and brown.<br>
        <br>
        "Curious anomaly, fantastic element!" said an ingenious naturalist, "in<br>
        which the animal kingdom blossoms, and the vegetable does not!"<br>
        <br>
        In about an hour Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt; I, for my part,<br>
        was not sorry, and we stretched ourselves under an arbour of alariae,<br>
        the long thin blades of which stood up like arrows.<br>
        <br>
        This short rest seemed delicious to me; there was nothing wanting but<br>
        the charm of conversation; but, impossible to speak, impossible to<br>
        answer, I only put my great copper head to Conseil's.  I saw the worthy<br>
        fellow's eyes glistening with delight, and, to show his satisfaction,<br>
        he shook himself in his breastplate of air, in the most comical way in<br>
        the world.<br>
        <br>
        After four hours of this walking, I was surprised not to find myself<br>
        dreadfully hungry.  How to account for this state of the stomach I<br>
        could not tell.  But instead I felt an insurmountable desire to sleep,<br>
        which happens to all divers.  And my eyes soon closed behind the thick<br>
        glasses, and I fell into a heavy slumber, which the movement alone had<br>
        prevented before.  Captain Nemo and his robust companion, stretched in<br>
        the clear crystal, set us the example.<br>
        <br>
        How long I remained buried in this drowsiness I cannot judge, but, when<br>
        I woke, the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon.  Captain Nemo had<br>
        already risen, and I was beginning to stretch my limbs, when an<br>
        unexpected apparition brought me briskly to my feet.<br>
        <br>
        A few steps off, a monstrous sea-spider, about thirty-eight inches<br>
        high, was watching me with squinting eyes, ready to spring upon me.<br>
        Though my diver's dress was thick enough to defend me from the bite of<br>
        this animal, I could not help shuddering with horror.  Conseil and the<br>
        sailor of the Nautilus awoke at this moment.  Captain Nemo pointed out<br>
        the hideous crustacean, which a blow from the butt end of the gun<br>
        knocked over, and I saw the horrible claws of the monster writhe in<br>
        terrible convulsions.  This incident reminded me that other animals<br>
        more to be feared might haunt these obscure depths, against whose<br>
        attacks my diving-dress would not protect me.  I had never thought of<br>
        it before, but I now resolved to be upon my guard.  Indeed, I thought<br>
        that this halt would mark the termination of our walk; but I was<br>
        <a href=../site1/page1_6843.html>internal_link0_text</a><br><br>
        mistaken, for, instead of returning to the Nautilus, Captain Nemo<br>
        continued his bold excursion.  The ground was still on the incline, its<br>
        declivity seemed to be getting greater, and to be leading us to greater<br>
        depths.  It must have been about three o'clock when we reached a narrow<br>
        valley, between high perpendicular walls, situated about seventy-five<br>
        fathoms deep.  Thanks to the perfection of our apparatus, we were<br>
        forty-five fathoms below the limit which nature seems to have imposed<br>
        on man as to his submarine excursions.<br>
        <br>
        I say seventy-five fathoms, though I had no instrument by which to<br>
        judge the distance.  But I knew that even in the clearest waters the<br>
        solar rays could not penetrate further.  And accordingly the darkness<br>
        deepened.  At ten paces not an object was visible.  I was groping my<br>
        way, when I suddenly saw a brilliant white light.  Captain Nemo had<br>
        just put his electric apparatus into use; his companion did the same,<br>
        and Conseil and I followed their example.  By turning a screw I<br>
        established a communication between the wire and the spiral glass, and<br>
        the sea, lit by our four lanterns, was illuminated for a circle of<br>
        thirty-six yards.<br>
        <br>
        As we walked I thought the light of our Ruhmkorff apparatus could not<br>
        fail to draw some inhabitant from its dark couch.  But if they did<br>
        approach us, they at least kept at a respectful distance from the<br>
        hunters.  Several times I saw Captain Nemo stop, put his gun to his<br>
        shoulder, and after some moments drop it and walk on.  At last, after<br>
        about four hours, this marvellous excursion came to an end.  A wall of<br>
        superb rocks, in an imposing mass, rose before us, a heap of gigantic<br>
        blocks, an enormous, steep granite shore, forming dark grottos, but<br>
        which presented no practicable slope; it was the prop of the Island of<br>
        Crespo.  It was the earth!  Captain Nemo stopped suddenly.  A gesture<br>
        of his brought us all to a halt; and, however desirous I might be to<br>
        scale the wall, I was obliged to stop.  Here ended Captain Nemo's<br>
        domains.  And he would not go beyond them.  Further on was a portion of<br>
        the globe he might not trample upon.<br>
        <br>
        The return began.  Captain Nemo had returned to the head of his little<br>
        band, directing their course without hesitation.  I thought we were not<br>
        following the same road to return to the Nautilus.  The new road was<br>
        very steep, and consequently very painful.  We approached the surface<br>
        of the sea rapidly.  But this return to the upper strata was not so<br>
        sudden as to cause relief from the pressure too rapidly, which might<br>
        have produced serious disorder in our organisation, and brought on<br>
        internal lesions, so fatal to divers.  Very soon light reappeared and<br>
        grew, and, the sun being low on the horizon, the refraction edged the<br>
        different objects with a spectral ring.  At ten yards and a half deep,<br>
        we walked amidst a shoal of little fishes of all kinds, more numerous<br>
        than the birds of the air, and also more agile; but no aquatic game<br>
        worthy of a shot had as yet met our gaze, when at that moment I saw the<br>
        Captain shoulder his gun quickly, and follow a moving object into the<br>
        shrubs.  He fired; I heard a slight hissing, and a creature fell<br>
        stunned at some distance from us.  It was a magnificent sea-otter, an<br>
        enhydrus, the only exclusively marine quadruped.  This otter was five<br>
        feet long, and must have been very valuable.  Its skin, chestnut-brown<br>
        above and silvery underneath, would have made one of those beautiful<br>
        furs so sought after in the Russian and Chinese markets: the fineness<br>
        and the lustre of its coat would certainly fetch L80.  I admired this<br>
        curious mammal, with its rounded head ornamented with short ears, its<br>
        round eyes, and white whiskers like those of a cat, with webbed feet<br>
        and nails, and tufted tail.  This precious animal, hunted and tracked<br>
        by fishermen, has now become very rare, and taken refuge chiefly in the<br>
        northern parts of the Pacific, or probably its race would soon become<br>
        extinct.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo's companion took the beast, threw it over his shoulder,<br>
        and we continued our journey.  For one hour a plain of sand lay<br>
        stretched before us.  Sometimes it rose to within two yards and some<br>
        inches of the surface of the water.  I then saw our image clearly<br>
        reflected, drawn inversely, and above us appeared an identical group<br>
        reflecting our movements and our actions; in a word, like us in every<br>
        point, except that they walked with their heads downward and their feet<br>
        in the air.<br>
        <br>
        Another effect I noticed, which was the passage of thick clouds which<br>
        formed and vanished rapidly; but on reflection I understood that these<br>
        seeming clouds were due to the varying thickness of the reeds at the<br>
        bottom, and I could even see the fleecy foam which their broken tops<br>
        multiplied on the water, and the shadows of large birds passing above<br>
        our heads, whose rapid flight I could discern on the surface of the sea.<br>
        <br>
        On this occasion I was witness to one of the finest gun shots which<br>
        ever made the nerves of a hunter thrill.  A large bird of great breadth<br>
        of wing, clearly visible, approached, hovering over us.  Captain Nemo's<br>
        companion shouldered his gun and fired, when it was only a few yards<br>
        above the waves.  The creature fell stunned, and the force of its fall<br>
        brought it within the reach of dexterous hunter's grasp.  It was an<br>
        albatross of the finest kind.<br>
        <br>
        Our march had not been interrupted by this incident.  For two hours we<br>
        followed these sandy plains, then fields of algae very disagreeable to<br>
        cross.  Candidly, I could do no more when I saw a glimmer of light,<br>
        which, for a half mile, broke the darkness of the waters.  It was the<br>
        lantern of the Nautilus.  Before twenty minutes were over we should be<br>
        on board, and I should be able to breathe with ease, for it seemed that<br>
        my reservoir supplied air very deficient in oxygen.  But I did not<br>
        reckon on an accidental meeting which delayed our arrival for some time.<br>
        <br>
        I had remained some steps behind, when I presently saw Captain Nemo<br>
        coming hurriedly towards me.  With his strong hand he bent me to the<br>
        ground, his companion doing the same to Conseil.  At first I knew not<br>
        what to think of this sudden attack, but I was soon reassured by seeing<br>
        the Captain lie down beside me, and remain immovable.<br>
        <br>
        I was stretched on the ground, just under the shelter of a bush of<br>
        algae, when, raising my head, I saw some enormous mass, casting<br>
        phosphorescent gleams, pass blusteringly by.<br>
        <br>
        My blood froze in my veins as I recognised two formidable sharks which<br>
        threatened us.  It was a couple of tintoreas, terrible creatures, with<br>
        enormous tails and a dull glassy stare, the phosphorescent matter<br>
        ejected from holes pierced around the muzzle.  Monstrous brutes! which<br>
        would crush a whole man in their iron jaws.  I did not know whether<br>
        Conseil stopped to classify them; for my part, I noticed their silver<br>
        bellies, and their huge mouths bristling with teeth, from a very<br>
        unscientific point of view, and more as a possible victim than as a<br>
        naturalist.<br>
        <br>
        Happily the voracious creatures do not see well.  They passed without<br>
        seeing us, brushing us with their brownish fins, and we escaped by a<br>
        miracle from a danger certainly greater than meeting a tiger full-face<br>
        in the forest.  Half an hour after, guided by the electric light we<br>
        reached the Nautilus.  The outside door had been left open, and Captain<br>
        Nemo closed it as soon as we had entered the first cell.  He then<br>
        pressed a knob.  I heard the pumps working in the midst of the vessel,<br>
        I felt the water sinking from around me, and in a few moments the cell<br>
        was entirely empty.  The inside door then opened, and we entered the<br>
        vestry.<br>
        <br>
        There our diving-dress was taken off, not without some trouble, and,<br>
        fairly worn out from want of food and sleep, I returned to my room, in<br>
        great wonder at this surprising excursion at the bottom of the sea.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XVII<br>
        <br>
        FOUR THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE PACIFIC<br>
        <br>
        The next morning, the 18th of November, I had quite recovered from my<br>
        fatigues of the day before, and I went up on to the platform, just as<br>
        the second lieutenant was uttering his daily phrase.<br>
        <br>
        I was admiring the magnificent aspect of the ocean when Captain Nemo<br>
        appeared.  He did not seem to be aware of my presence, and began a<br>
        series of astronomical observations.  Then, when he had finished, he<br>
        went and leant on the cage of the watch-light, and gazed abstractedly<br>
        on the ocean.  In the meantime, a number of the sailors of the<br>
        Nautilus, all strong and healthy men, had come up onto the platform.<br>
        They came to draw up the nets that had been laid all night.  These<br>
        sailors were evidently of different nations, although the European type<br>
        was visible in all of them.  I recognised some unmistakable Irishmen,<br>
        Frenchmen, some Sclaves, and a Greek, or a Candiote.  They were civil,<br>
        and only used that odd language among themselves, the origin of which I<br>
        could not guess, neither could I question them.<br>
        <br>
        The nets were hauled in.  They were a large kind of "chaluts," like<br>
        those on the Normandy coasts, great pockets that the waves and a chain<br>
        fixed in the smaller meshes kept open.  These pockets, drawn by iron<br>
        poles, swept through the water, and gathered in everything in their<br>
        way.  That day they brought up curious specimens from those productive<br>
        coasts.<br>
        <br>
        I reckoned that the haul had brought in more than nine hundredweight of<br>
        fish.  It was a fine haul, but not to be wondered at.  Indeed, the nets<br>
        are let down for several hours, and enclose in their meshes an infinite<br>
        variety.  We had no lack of excellent food, and the rapidity of the<br>
        Nautilus and the attraction of the electric light could always renew<br>
        our supply.  These several productions of the sea were immediately<br>
        lowered through the panel to the steward's room, some to be eaten<br>
        fresh, and others pickled.<br>
        <br>
        The fishing ended, the provision of air renewed, I thought that the<br>
        Nautilus was about to continue its submarine excursion, and was<br>
        preparing to return to my room, when, without further preamble, the<br>
        Captain turned to me, saying:<br>
        <br>
        "Professor, is not this ocean gifted with real life?  It has its<br>
        tempers and its gentle moods.  Yesterday it slept as we did, and now it<br>
        has woke after a quiet night.  Look!" he continued, "it wakes under the<br>
        caresses of the sun.  It is going to renew its diurnal existence.  It<br>
        is an interesting study to watch the play of its organisation.  It has<br>
        a pulse, arteries, spasms; and I agree with the learned Maury, who<br>
        discovered in it a circulation as real as the circulation of blood in<br>
        animals.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, the ocean has indeed circulation, and to promote it, the Creator<br>
        has caused things to multiply in it--caloric, salt, and animalculae."<br>
        <br>
        When Captain Nemo spoke thus, he seemed altogether changed, and aroused<br>
        an extraordinary emotion in me.<br>
        <br>
        "Also," he added, "true existence is there; and I can imagine the<br>
        foundations of nautical towns, clusters of submarine houses, which,<br>
        like the Nautilus, would ascend every morning to breathe at the surface<br>
        of the water, free towns, independent cities.  Yet who knows whether<br>
        some despot----"<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo finished his sentence with a violent gesture.  Then,<br>
        addressing me as if to chase away some sorrowful thought:<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax," he asked, "do you know the depth of the ocean?"<br>
        <br>
        "I only know, Captain, what the principal soundings have taught us."<br>
        <br>
        "Could you tell me them, so that I can suit them to my purpose?"<br>
        <br>
        "These are some," I replied, "that I remember.  If I am not mistaken, a<br>
        depth of 8,000 yards has been found in the North Atlantic, and 2,500<br>
        yards in the Mediterranean.  The most remarkable soundings have been<br>
        made in the South Atlantic, near the thirty-fifth parallel, and they<br>
        gave 12,000 yards, 14,000 yards, and 15,000 yards.  To sum up all, it<br>
        is reckoned that if the bottom of the sea were levelled, its mean depth<br>
        would be about one and three-quarter leagues."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Professor," replied the Captain, "we shall show you better than<br>
        that I hope.  As to the mean depth of this part of the Pacific, I tell<br>
        you it is only 4,000 yards."<br>
        <br>
        Having said this, Captain Nemo went towards the panel, and disappeared<br>
        down the ladder.  I followed him, and went into the large drawing-room.<br>
        The screw was immediately put in motion, and the log gave twenty miles<br>
        an hour.<br>
        <br>
        During the days and weeks that passed, Captain Nemo was very sparing of<br>
        his visits.  I seldom saw him.  The lieutenant pricked the ship's<br>
        course regularly on the chart, so I could always tell exactly the route<br>
        of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        Nearly every day, for some time, the panels of the drawing-room were<br>
        opened, and we were never tired of penetrating the mysteries of the<br>
        submarine world.<br>
        <br>
        The general direction of the Nautilus was south-east, and it kept<br>
        between 100 and 150 yards of depth.  One day, however, I do not know<br>
        why, being drawn diagonally by means of the inclined planes, it touched<br>
        the bed of the sea.  The thermometer indicated a temperature of 4.25<br>
        (cent.): a temperature that at this depth seemed common to all<br>
        latitudes.<br>
        <br>
        At three o'clock in the morning of the 26th of November the Nautilus<br>
        crossed the tropic of Cancer at 172° long.  On 27th instant it<br>
        sighted the Sandwich Islands, where Cook died, February 14, 1779.  We<br>
        had then gone 4,860 leagues from our starting-point. In the morning,<br>
        when I went on the platform, I saw two miles to windward, Hawaii, the<br>
        largest of the seven islands that form the group.  I saw clearly the<br>
        cultivated ranges, and the several mountain-chains that run parallel<br>
        with the side, and the volcanoes that overtop Mouna-Rea, which rise<br>
        5,000 yards above the level of the sea.  Besides other things the nets<br>
        brought up, were several flabellariae and graceful polypi, that are<br>
        peculiar to that part of the ocean.  The direction of the Nautilus was<br>
        still to the south-east. It crossed the equator December 1, in 142°<br>
        long.; and on the 4th of the same month, after crossing rapidly and<br>
        without anything in particular occurring, we sighted the Marquesas<br>
        group.  I saw, three miles off, Martin's peak in Nouka-Hiva, the<br>
        largest of the group that belongs to France.  I only saw the woody<br>
        mountains against the horizon, because Captain Nemo did not wish to<br>
        bring the ship to the wind.  There the nets brought up beautiful<br>
        specimens of fish:  some with azure fins and tails like gold, the flesh<br>
        of which is unrivalled; some nearly destitute of scales, but of<br>
        exquisite flavour; others, with bony jaws, and yellow-tinged gills, as<br>
        good as bonitos; all fish that would be of use to us.  After leaving<br>
        these charming islands protected by the French flag, from the 4th to<br>
        the 11th of December the Nautilus sailed over about 2,000 miles.<br>
        <br>
        During the daytime of the 11th of December I was busy reading in the<br>
        large drawing-room. Ned Land and Conseil watched the luminous water<br>
        through the half-open panels.  The Nautilus was immovable.  While its<br>
        reservoirs were filled, it kept at a depth of 1,000 yards, a region<br>
        rarely visited in the ocean, and in which large fish were seldom seen.<br>
        <br>
        I was then reading a charming book by Jean Mace, The Slaves of the<br>
        Stomach, and I was learning some valuable lessons from it, when Conseil<br>
        interrupted me.<br>
        <br>
        "Will master come here a moment?" he said, in a curious voice.<br>
        <a href=../site1/page1_3761.html>internal_link1_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        "What is the matter, Conseil?"<br>
        <br>
        "I want master to look."<br>
        <br>
        I rose, went, and leaned on my elbows before the panes and watched.<br>
        <br>
        In a full electric light, an enormous black mass, quite immovable, was<br>
        suspended in the midst of the waters.  I watched it attentively,<br>
        seeking to find out the nature of this gigantic cetacean.  But a sudden<br>
        thought crossed my mind.  "A vessel!" I said, half aloud.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," replied the Canadian, "a disabled ship that has sunk<br>
        perpendicularly."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land was right; we were close to a vessel of which the tattered<br>
        shrouds still hung from their chains.  The keel seemed to be in good<br>
        order, and it had been wrecked at most some few hours.  Three stumps of<br>
        masts, broken off about two feet above the bridge, showed that the<br>
        vessel had had to sacrifice its masts.  But, lying on its side, it had<br>
        filled, and it was heeling over to port.  This skeleton of what it had<br>
        once been was a sad spectacle as it lay lost under the waves, but<br>
        sadder still was the sight of the bridge, where some corpses, bound<br>
        with ropes, were still lying.  I counted five--four men, one of whom<br>
        was standing at the helm, and a woman standing by the poop, holding an<br>
        infant in her arms.  She was quite young.  I could distinguish her<br>
        features, which the water had not decomposed, by the brilliant light<br>
        from the Nautilus.  In one despairing effort, she had raised her infant<br>
        above her head--poor little thing!--whose arms encircled its mother's<br>
        neck.  The attitude of the four sailors was frightful, distorted as<br>
        they were by their convulsive movements, whilst making a last effort to<br>
        free themselves from the cords that bound them to the vessel.  The<br>
        steersman alone, calm, with a grave, clear face, his grey hair glued to<br>
        his forehead, and his hand clutching the wheel of the helm, seemed even<br>
        then to be guiding the three broken masts through the depths of the<br>
        ocean.<br>
        <br>
        What a scene!  We were dumb; our hearts beat fast before this<br>
        shipwreck, taken as it were from life and photographed in its last<br>
        moments.  And I saw already, coming towards it with hungry eyes,<br>
        enormous sharks, attracted by the human flesh.<br>
        <br>
        However, the Nautilus, turning, went round the submerged vessel, and in<br>
        one instant I read on the stern--"The Florida, Sunderland."<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XVIII<br>
        <br>
        VANIKORO<br>
        <br>
        This terrible spectacle was the forerunner of the series of maritime<br>
        catastrophes that the Nautilus was destined to meet with in its route.<br>
        As long as it went through more frequented waters, we often saw the<br>
        hulls of shipwrecked vessels that were rotting in the depths, and<br>
        deeper down cannons, bullets, anchors, chains, and a thousand other<br>
        iron materials eaten up by rust.  However, on the 11th of December we<br>
        sighted the Pomotou Islands, the old "dangerous group" of Bougainville,<br>
        that extend over a space of 500 leagues at E.S.E. to W.N.W., from the<br>
        Island Ducie to that of Lazareff.  This group covers an area of 370<br>
        square leagues, and it is formed of sixty groups of islands, among<br>
        which the Gambier group is remarkable, over which France exercises<br>
        sway.  These are coral islands, slowly raised, but continuous, created<br>
        by the daily work of polypi.  Then this new island will be joined later<br>
        on to the neighboring groups, and a fifth continent will stretch from<br>
        New Zealand and New Caledonia, and from thence to the Marquesas.<br>
        <br>
        One day, when I was suggesting this theory to Captain Nemo, he replied<br>
        coldly:<br>
        <br>
        "The earth does not want new continents, but new men."<br>
        <br>
        Chance had conducted the Nautilus towards the Island of<br>
        Clermont-Tonnere, one of the most curious of the group, that was<br>
        discovered in 1822 by Captain Bell of the Minerva. I could study now<br>
        the madreporal system, to which are due the islands in this ocean.<br>
        <br>
        Madrepores (which must not be mistaken for corals) have a tissue lined<br>
        with a calcareous crust, and the modifications of its structure have<br>
        induced M. Milne Edwards, my worthy master, to class them into five<br>
        sections. The animalcule that the marine polypus secretes live by<br>
        millions at the bottom of their cells. Their calcareous deposits become<br>
        rocks, reefs, and large and small islands. Here they form a ring,<br>
        surrounding a little inland lake, that communicates with the sea by<br>
        means of gaps. There they make barriers of reefs like those on the<br>
        coasts of New Caledonia and the various Pomoton islands. In other<br>
        places, like those at Reunion and at Maurice, they raise fringed reefs,<br>
        high, straight walls, near which the depth of the ocean is considerable.<br>
        <br>
        Some cable-lengths off the shores of the Island of Clermont I admired<br>
        the gigantic work accomplished by these microscopical workers. These<br>
        walls are specially the work of those madrepores known as milleporas,<br>
        porites, madrepores, and astraeas. These polypi are found particularly<br>
        in the rough beds of the sea, near the surface; and consequently it is<br>
        from the upper part that they begin their operations, in which they<br>
        bury themselves by degrees with the debris of the secretions that<br>
        support them. Such is, at least, Darwin's theory, who thus explains the<br>
        formation of the _atolls_, a superior theory (to my mind) to that given<br>
        of the foundation of the madreporical works, summits of mountains or<br>
        volcanoes, that are submerged some feet below the level of the sea.<br>
        <br>
        I could observe closely these curious walls, for perpendicularly they<br>
        were more than 300 yards deep, and our electric sheets lighted up this<br>
        calcareous matter brilliantly. Replying to a question Conseil asked me<br>
        as to the time these colossal barriers took to be raised, I astonished<br>
        him much by telling him that learned men reckoned it about the eighth<br>
        of an inch in a hundred years.<br>
        <br>
        Towards evening Clermont-Tonnerre was lost in the distance, and the<br>
        route of the Nautilus was sensibly changed. After having crossed the<br>
        tropic of Capricorn in 135° longitude, it sailed W.N.W., making<br>
        again for the tropical zone. Although the summer sun was very strong,<br>
        we did not suffer from heat, for at fifteen or twenty fathoms below the<br>
        surface, the temperature did not rise above from ten to twelve degrees.<br>
        <br>
        On 15th of December, we left to the east the bewitching group of the<br>
        Societies and the graceful Tahiti, queen of the Pacific.  I saw in the<br>
        morning, some miles to the windward, the elevated summits of the<br>
        island.  These waters furnished our table with excellent fish,<br>
        mackerel, bonitos, and some varieties of a sea-serpent.<br>
        <br>
        On the 25th of December the Nautilus sailed into the midst of the New<br>
        Hebrides, discovered by Quiros in 1606, and that Bougainville explored<br>
        in 1768, and to which Cook gave its present name in 1773.  This group<br>
        is composed principally of nine large islands, that form a band of 120<br>
        leagues N.N.S. to S.S.W., between 15° and 2° S. lat., and 164<br>
        deg. and 168° long.  We passed tolerably near to the Island of<br>
        Aurou, that at noon looked like a mass of green woods, surmounted by a<br>
        peak of great height.<br>
        <br>
        That day being Christmas Day, Ned Land seemed to regret sorely the<br>
        non-celebration of "Christmas," the family fete of which Protestants<br>
        are so fond.  I had not seen Captain Nemo for a week, when, on the<br>
        morning of the 27th, he came into the large drawing-room, always<br>
        seeming as if he had seen you five minutes before.  I was busily<br>
        tracing the route of the Nautilus on the planisphere.  The Captain came<br>
        up to me, put his finger on one spot on the chart, and said this single<br>
        word.<br>
        <br>
        "Vanikoro."<br>
        <br>
        The effect was magical!  It was the name of the islands on which La<br>
        Perouse had been lost!  I rose suddenly.<br>
        <br>
        "The Nautilus has brought us to Vanikoro?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Professor," said the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        "And I can visit the celebrated islands where the Boussole and the<br>
        Astrolabe struck?"<br>
        <br>
        "If you like, Professor."<br>
        <br>
        "When shall we be there?"<br>
        <br>
        "We are there now."<br>
        <br>
        Followed by Captain Nemo, I went up on to the platform, and greedily<br>
        scanned the horizon.<br>
        <br>
        To the N.E. two volcanic islands emerged of unequal size, surrounded by<br>
        a coral reef that measured forty miles in circumference.  We were close<br>
        to Vanikoro, really the one to which Dumont d'Urville gave the name of<br>
        Isle de la Recherche, and exactly facing the little harbour of Vanou,<br>
        situated in 16° 4' S. lat., and 164° 32' E. long.  The earth<br>
        seemed covered with verdure from the shore to the summits in the<br>
        interior, that were crowned by Mount Kapogo, 476 feet high.  The<br>
        Nautilus, having passed the outer belt of rocks by a narrow strait,<br>
        found itself among breakers where the sea was from thirty to forty<br>
        fathoms deep.  Under the verdant shade of some mangroves I perceived<br>
        some savages, who appeared greatly surprised at our approach.  In the<br>
        long black body, moving between wind and water, did they not see some<br>
        formidable cetacean that they regarded with suspicion?<br>
        <br>
        Just then Captain Nemo asked me what I knew about the wreck of La<br>
        Perouse.<br>
        <br>
        "Only what everyone knows, Captain," I replied.<br>
        <br>
        "And could you tell me what everyone knows about it?" he inquired,<br>
        ironically.<br>
        <br>
        "Easily."<br>
        <br>
        I related to him all that the last works of Dumont d'Urville had made<br>
        known--works from which the following is a brief account.<br>
        <br>
        La Perouse, and his second, Captain de Langle, were sent by Louis XVI,<br>
        in 1785, on a voyage of circumnavigation.  They embarked in the<br>
        corvettes Boussole and the Astrolabe, neither of which were again heard<br>
        of.  In 1791, the French Government, justly uneasy as to the fate of<br>
        these two sloops, manned two large merchantmen, the Recherche and the<br>
        Esperance, which left Brest the 28th of September under the command of<br>
        Bruni d'Entrecasteaux.<br>
        <br>
        Two months after, they learned from Bowen, commander of the Albemarle,<br>
        that the debris of shipwrecked vessels had been seen on the coasts of<br>
        New Georgia.  But D'Entrecasteaux, ignoring this communication--rather<br>
        uncertain, besides--directed his course towards the Admiralty Islands,<br>
        mentioned in a report of Captain Hunter's as being the place where La<br>
        Perouse was wrecked.<br>
        <br>
        They sought in vain.  The Esperance and the Recherche passed before<br>
        Vanikoro without stopping there, and, in fact, this voyage was most<br>
        disastrous, as it cost D'Entrecasteaux his life, and those of two of<br>
        his lieutenants, besides several of his crew.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Dillon, a shrewd old Pacific sailor, was the first to find<br>
        unmistakable traces of the wrecks.  On the 15th of May, 1824, his<br>
        vessel, the St. Patrick, passed close to Tikopia, one of the New<br>
        Hebrides.  There a Lascar came alongside in a canoe, sold him the<br>
        handle of a sword in silver that bore the print of characters engraved<br>
        on the hilt.  The Lascar pretended that six years before, during a stay<br>
        at Vanikoro, he had seen two Europeans that belonged to some vessels<br>
        that had run aground on the reefs some years ago.<br>
        <br>
        Dillon guessed that he meant La Perouse, whose disappearance had<br>
        troubled the whole world.  He tried to get on to Vanikoro, where,<br>
        according to the Lascar, he would find numerous debris of the wreck,<br>
        but winds and tides prevented him.<br>
        <br>
        Dillon returned to Calcutta.  There he interested the Asiatic Society<br>
        and the Indian Company in his discovery.  A vessel, to which was given<br>
        the name of the Recherche, was put at his disposal, and he set out,<br>
        23rd January, 1827, accompanied by a French agent.<br>
        <br>
        The Recherche, after touching at several points in the Pacific, cast<br>
        anchor before Vanikoro, 7th July, 1827, in that same harbour of Vanou<br>
        where the Nautilus was at this time.<br>
        <br>
        There it collected numerous relics of the wreck--iron utensils,<br>
        anchors, pulley-strops, swivel-guns, an 18 lb. shot, fragments of<br>
        astronomical instruments, a piece of crown work, and a bronze clock,<br>
        bearing this inscription--"Bazin m'a fait," the mark of the foundry of<br>
        the arsenal at Brest about 1785.  There could be no further doubt.<br>
        <br>
        Dillon, having made all inquiries, stayed in the unlucky place till<br>
        October.  Then he quitted Vanikoro, and directed his course towards New<br>
        Zealand; put into Calcutta, 7th April, 1828, and returned to France,<br>
        where he was warmly welcomed by Charles X.<br>
        <br>
        But at the same time, without knowing Dillon's movements, Dumont<br>
        d'Urville had already set out to find the scene of the wreck.  And they<br>
        had learned from a whaler that some medals and a cross of St. Louis had<br>
        been found in the hands of some savages of Louisiade and New Caledonia.<br>
        Dumont d'Urville, commander of the Astrolabe, had then sailed, and two<br>
        months after Dillon had left Vanikoro he put into Hobart Town.  There<br>
        he learned the results of Dillon's inquiries, and found that a certain<br>
        James Hobbs, second lieutenant of the Union of Calcutta, after landing<br>
        on an island situated 8° 18' S. lat., and 156° 30' E. long.,<br>
        had seen some iron bars and red stuffs used by the natives of these<br>
        parts.  Dumont d'Urville, much perplexed, and not knowing how to credit<br>
        the reports of low-class journals, decided to follow Dillon's track.<br>
        <br>
        On the 10th of February, 1828, the Astrolabe appeared off Tikopia, and<br>
        took as guide and interpreter a deserter found on the island; made his<br>
        way to Vanikoro, sighted it on the 12th inst., lay among the reefs<br>
        until the 14th, and not until the 20th did he cast anchor within the<br>
        barrier in the harbour of Vanou.<br>
        <br>
        On the 23rd, several officers went round the island and brought back<br>
        some unimportant trifles.  The natives, adopting a system of denials<br>
        and evasions, refused to take them to the unlucky place.  This<br>
        ambiguous conduct led them to believe that the natives had ill-treated<br>
        the castaways, and indeed they seemed to fear that Dumont d'Urville had<br>
        come to avenge La Perouse and his unfortunate crew.<br>
        <br>
        However, on the 26th, appeased by some presents, and understanding that<br>
        they had no reprisals to fear, they led M. Jacquireot to the scene of<br>
        the wreck.<br>
        <br>
        There, in three or four fathoms of water, between the reefs of Pacou<br>
        and Vanou, lay anchors, cannons, pigs of lead and iron, embedded in the<br>
        limy concretions.  The large boat and the whaler belonging to the<br>
        <a href=../site4/page4_2175.html>external_link2_text</a><br><br>
        Astrolabe were sent to this place, and, not without some difficulty,<br>
        their crews hauled up an anchor weighing 1,800 lbs., a brass gun, some<br>
        pigs of iron, and two copper swivel-guns.<br>
        <br>
        Dumont d'Urville, questioning the natives, learned too that La Perouse,<br>
        after losing both his vessels on the reefs of this island, had<br>
        constructed a smaller boat, only to be lost a second time.  Where, no<br>
        one knew.<br>
        <br>
        But the French Government, fearing that Dumont d'Urville was not<br>
        acquainted with Dillon's movements, had sent the sloop Bayonnaise,<br>
        commanded by Legoarant de Tromelin, to Vanikoro, which had been<br>
        stationed on the west coast of America.  The Bayonnaise cast her anchor<br>
        before Vanikoro some months after the departure of the Astrolabe, but<br>
        found no new document; but stated that the savages had respected the<br>
        monument to La Perouse.  That is the substance of what I told Captain<br>
        Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "So," he said, "no one knows now where the third vessel perished that<br>
        was constructed by the castaways on the island of Vanikoro?"<br>
        <br>
        "No one knows."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo said nothing, but signed to me to follow him into the<br>
        large saloon.  The Nautilus sank several yards below the waves, and the<br>
        panels were opened.<br>
        <br>
        I hastened to the aperture, and under the crustations of coral, covered<br>
        with fungi, syphonules, alcyons, madrepores, through myriads of<br>
        charming fish--girelles, glyphisidri, pompherides, diacopes, and<br>
        holocentres--I recognised certain debris that the drags had not been<br>
        able to tear up--iron stirrups, anchors, cannons, bullets, capstan<br>
        fittings, the stem of a ship, all objects clearly proving the wreck of<br>
        some vessel, and now carpeted with living flowers. While I was looking<br>
        on this desolate scene, Captain Nemo said, in a sad voice:<br>
        <br>
        "Commander La Perouse set out 7th December, 1785, with his vessels La<br>
        Boussole and the Astrolabe.  He first cast anchor at Botany Bay,<br>
        visited the Friendly Isles, New Caledonia, then directed his course<br>
        towards Santa Cruz, and put into Namouka, one of the Hapai group.  Then<br>
        his vessels struck on the unknown reefs of Vanikoro.  The Boussole,<br>
        which went first, ran aground on the southerly coast.  The Astrolabe<br>
        went to its help, and ran aground too.  The first vessel was destroyed<br>
        almost immediately.  The second, stranded under the wind, resisted some<br>
        days.  The natives made the castaways welcome.  They installed<br>
        themselves in the island, and constructed a smaller boat with the<br>
        debris of the two large ones.  Some sailors stayed willingly at<br>
        Vanikoro; the others, weak and ill, set out with La Perouse.  They<br>
        directed their course towards the Solomon Islands, and there perished,<br>
        with everything, on the westerly coast of the chief island of the<br>
        group, between Capes Deception and Satisfaction."<br>
        <br>
        "How do you know that?"<br>
        <br>
        "By this, that I found on the spot where was the last wreck."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo showed me a tin-plate box, stamped with the French arms,<br>
        and corroded by the salt water.  He opened it, and I saw a bundle of<br>
        papers, yellow but still readable.<br>
        <br>
        They were the instructions of the naval minister to Commander La<br>
        Perouse, annotated in the margin in Louis XVI's handwriting.<br>
        <br>
        "Ah! it is a fine death for a sailor!" said Captain Nemo, at last.  "A<br>
        coral tomb makes a quiet grave; and I trust that I and my comrades will<br>
        find no other."<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XIX<br>
        <br>
        TORRES STRAITS<br>
        <br>
        During the night of the 27th or 28th of December, the Nautilus left the<br>
        shores of Vanikoro with great speed.  Her course was south-westerly,<br>
        and in three days she had gone over the 750 leagues that separated it<br>
        from La Perouse's group and the south-east point of Papua.<br>
        <br>
        Early on the 1st of January, 1863, Conseil joined me on the platform.<br>
        <br>
        "Master, will you permit me to wish you a happy New Year?"<br>
        <br>
        "What!  Conseil; exactly as if I was at Paris in my study at the Jardin<br>
        des Plantes?  Well, I accept your good wishes, and thank you for them.<br>
        Only, I will ask you what you mean by a `Happy New Year' under our<br>
        circumstances?  Do you mean the year that will bring us to the end of<br>
        our imprisonment, or the year that sees us continue this strange<br>
        voyage?"<br>
        <br>
        "Really, I do not know how to answer, master.  We are sure to see<br>
        curious things, and for the last two months we have not had time for<br>
        dullness.  The last marvel is always the most astonishing; and, if we<br>
        continue this progression, I do not know how it will end.  It is my<br>
        opinion that we shall never again see the like.  I think then, with no<br>
        offence to master, that a happy year would be one in which we could see<br>
        everything."<br>
        <br>
        On 2nd January we had made 11,340 miles, or 5,250 French leagues, since<br>
        our starting-point in the Japan Seas.  Before the ship's head stretched<br>
        the dangerous shores of the coral sea, on the north-east coast of<br>
        Australia.  Our boat lay along some miles from the redoubtable bank on<br>
        which Cook's vessel was lost, 10th June, 1770.  The boat in which Cook<br>
        was struck on a rock, and, if it did not sink, it was owing to a piece<br>
        of coral that was broken by the shock, and fixed itself in the broken<br>
        keel.<br>
        <br>
        I had wished to visit the reef, 360 leagues long, against which the<br>
        sea, always rough, broke with great violence, with a noise like<br>
        thunder.  But just then the inclined planes drew the Nautilus down to a<br>
        great depth, and I could see nothing of the high coral walls.  I had to<br>
        content myself with the different specimens of fish brought up by the<br>
        nets.  I remarked, among others, some germons, a species of mackerel as<br>
        large as a tunny, with bluish sides, and striped with transverse bands,<br>
        that disappear with the animal's life.<br>
        <br>
        These fish followed us in shoals, and furnished us with very delicate<br>
        food. We took also a large number of gilt-heads, about one and a half<br>
        inches long, tasting like dorys; and flying pyrapeds like submarine<br>
        swallows, which, in dark nights, light alternately the air and water<br>
        with their phosphorescent light. Among the molluscs and zoophytes, I<br>
        found in the meshes of the net several species of alcyonarians, echini,<br>
        hammers, spurs, dials, cerites, and hyalleae. The flora was represented<br>
        by beautiful floating seaweeds, laminariae, and macrocystes,<br>
        impregnated with the mucilage that transudes through their pores; and<br>
        among which I gathered an admirable Nemastoma Geliniarois, that was<br>
        classed among the natural curiosities of the museum.<br>
        <br>
        Two days after crossing the coral sea, 4th January, we sighted the<br>
        Papuan coasts.  On this occasion, Captain Nemo informed me that his<br>
        intention was to get into the Indian Ocean by the Strait of Torres.<br>
        His communication ended there.<br>
        <br>
        The Torres Straits are nearly thirty-four leagues wide; but they are<br>
        obstructed by an innumerable quantity of islands, islets, breakers, and<br>
        rocks, that make its navigation almost impracticable; so that Captain<br>
        Nemo took all needful precautions to cross them.  The Nautilus,<br>
        floating betwixt wind and water, went at a moderate pace.  Her screw,<br>
        like a cetacean's tail, beat the waves slowly.<br>
        <br>
        Profiting by this, I and my two companions went up on to the deserted<br>
        platform.  Before us was the steersman's cage, and I expected that<br>
        Captain Nemo was there directing the course of the Nautilus.  I had<br>
        before me the excellent charts of the Straits of Torres, and I<br>
        consulted them attentively.  Round the Nautilus the sea dashed<br>
        furiously.  The course of the waves, that went from south-east to<br>
        north-west at the rate of two and a half miles, broke on the coral that<br>
        showed itself here and there.<br>
        <br>
        "This is a bad sea!" remarked Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        "Detestable indeed, and one that does not suit a boat like the<br>
        Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        "The Captain must be very sure of his route, for I see there pieces of<br>
        coral that would do for its keel if it only touched them slightly."<br>
        <br>
        Indeed the situation was dangerous, but the Nautilus seemed to slide<br>
        like magic off these rocks.  It did not follow the routes of the<br>
        Astrolabe and the Zelee exactly, for they proved fatal to Dumont<br>
        d'Urville. It bore more northwards, coasted the Islands of Murray, and<br>
        came back to the south-west towards Cumberland Passage.  I thought it<br>
        was going to pass it by, when, going back to north-west, it went<br>
        through a large quantity of islands and islets little known, towards<br>
        the Island Sound and Canal Mauvais.<br>
        <br>
        I wondered if Captain Nemo, foolishly imprudent, would steer his vessel<br>
        into that pass where Dumont d'Urville's two corvettes touched; when,<br>
        swerving again, and cutting straight through to the west, he steered<br>
        for the Island of Gilboa.<br>
        <br>
        It was then three in the afternoon.  The tide began to recede, being<br>
        quite full.  The Nautilus approached the island, that I still saw, with<br>
        its remarkable border of screw-pines. He stood off it at about two<br>
        miles distant.  Suddenly a shock overthrew me.  The Nautilus just<br>
        touched a rock, and stayed immovable, laying lightly to port side.<br>
        <br>
        When I rose, I perceived Captain Nemo and his lieutenant on the<br>
        platform.  They were examining the situation of the vessel, and<br>
        exchanging words in their incomprehensible dialect.<br>
        <br>
        She was situated thus:  Two miles, on the starboard side, appeared<br>
        Gilboa, stretching from north to west like an immense arm.  Towards the<br>
        south and east some coral showed itself, left by the ebb.  We had run<br>
        aground, and in one of those seas where the tides are middling--a sorry<br>
        matter for the floating of the Nautilus.  However, the vessel had not<br>
        suffered, for her keel was solidly joined.  But, if she could neither<br>
        glide off nor move, she ran the risk of being for ever fastened to<br>
        these rocks, and then Captain Nemo's submarine vessel would be done for.<br>
        <br>
        I was reflecting thus, when the Captain, cool and calm, always master<br>
        of himself, approached me.<br>
        <br>
        "An accident?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "No; an incident."<br>
        <br>
        "But an incident that will oblige you perhaps to become an inhabitant<br>
        of this land from which you flee?"<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo looked at me curiously, and made a negative gesture, as<br>
        much as to say that nothing would force him to set foot on terra firma<br>
        again.  Then he said:<br>
        <br>
        "Besides, M. Aronnax, the Nautilus is not lost; it will carry you yet<br>
        into the midst of the marvels of the ocean.  Our voyage is only begun,<br>
        and I do not wish to be deprived so soon of the honour of your company."<br>
        <br>
        "However, Captain Nemo," I replied, without noticing the ironical turn<br>
        of his phrase, "the Nautilus ran aground in open sea.  Now the tides<br>
        are not strong in the Pacific; and, if you cannot lighten the Nautilus,<br>
        I do not see how it will be reinflated."<br>
        <br>
        "The tides are not strong in the Pacific:  you are right there,<br>
        Professor; but in Torres Straits one finds still a difference of a yard<br>
        and a half between the level of high and low seas.  To-day is 4th<br>
        January, and in five days the moon will be full.  Now, I shall be very<br>
        much astonished if that satellite does not raise these masses of water<br>
        sufficiently, and render me a service that I should be indebted to her<br>
        for."<br>
        <br>
        Having said this, Captain Nemo, followed by his lieutenant, redescended<br>
        to the interior of the Nautilus.  As to the vessel, it moved not, and<br>
        was immovable, as if the coralline polypi had already walled it up with<br>
        their in destructible cement.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, sir?" said Ned Land, who came up to me after the departure of<br>
        the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, friend Ned, we will wait patiently for the tide on the 9th<br>
        instant; for it appears that the moon will have the goodness to put it<br>
        off again."<br>
        <br>
        "Really?"<br>
        <br>
        "Really."<br>
        <br>
        "And this Captain is not going to cast anchor at all since the tide<br>
        will suffice?" said Conseil, simply.<br>
        <br>
        The Canadian looked at Conseil, then shrugged his shoulders.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir, you may believe me when I tell you that this piece of iron will<br>
        navigate neither on nor under the sea again; it is only fit to be sold<br>
        for its weight.  I think, therefore, that the time has come to part<br>
        company with Captain Nemo."<br>
        <br>
        "Friend Ned, I do not despair of this stout Nautilus, as you do; and in<br>
        four days we shall know what to hold to on the Pacific tides.  Besides,<br>
        flight might be possible if we were in sight of the English or<br>
        Provencal coast; but on the Papuan shores, it is another thing; and it<br>
        will be time enough to come to that extremity if the Nautilus does not<br>
        recover itself again, which I look upon as a grave event."<br>
        <br>
        "But do they know, at least, how to act circumspectly?  There is an<br>
        island; on that island there are trees; under those trees, terrestrial<br>
        animals, bearers of cutlets and roast beef, to which I would willingly<br>
        give a trial."<br>
        <br>
        "In this, friend Ned is right," said Conseil, "and I agree with him.<br>
        Could not master obtain permission from his friend Captain Nemo to put<br>
        us on land, if only so as not to lose the habit of treading on the<br>
        solid parts of our planet?"<br>
        <br>
        "I can ask him, but he will refuse."<br>
        <br>
        "Will master risk it?" asked Conseil, "and we shall know how to rely<br>
        upon the Captain's amiability."<br>
        <br>
        To my great surprise, Captain Nemo gave me the permission I asked for,<br>
        and he gave it very agreeably, without even exacting from me a promise<br>
        to return to the vessel; but flight across New Guinea might be very<br>
        perilous, and I should not have counselled Ned Land to attempt it.<br>
        Better to be a prisoner on board the Nautilus than to fall into the<br>
        hands of the natives.<br>
        <a href=../site4/page4_1385.html>external_link3_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        At eight o'clock, armed with guns and hatchets, we got off the<br>
        Nautilus.  The sea was pretty calm; a slight breeze blew on land.<br>
        Conseil and I rowing, we sped along quickly, and Ned steered in the<br>
        straight passage that the breakers left between them.  The boat was<br>
        well handled, and moved rapidly.<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land could not restrain his joy.  He was like a prisoner that had<br>
        escaped from prison, and knew not that it was necessary to re-enter it.<br>
        <br>
        "Meat!  We are going to eat some meat; and what meat!" he replied.<br>
        "Real game! no, bread, indeed."<br>
        <br>
        "I do not say that fish is not good; we must not abuse it; but a piece<br>
        of fresh venison, grilled on live coals, will agreeably vary our<br>
        ordinary course."<br>
        <br>
        "Glutton!" said Conseil, "he makes my mouth water."<br>
        <br>
        "It remains to be seen," I said, "if these forests are full of game,<br>
        and if the game is not such as will hunt the hunter himself."<br>
        <br>
        "Well said, M. Aronnax," replied the Canadian, whose teeth seemed<br>
        sharpened like the edge of a hatchet; "but I will eat tiger--loin of<br>
        tiger--if there is no other quadruped on this island."<br>
        <br>
        "Friend Ned is uneasy about it," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Whatever it may be," continued Ned Land, "every animal with four paws<br>
        without feathers, or with two paws without feathers, will be saluted by<br>
        my first shot."<br>
        <br>
        "Very well!  Master Land's imprudences are beginning."<br>
        <br>
        "Never fear, M. Aronnax," replied the Canadian; "I do not want<br>
        twenty-five minutes to offer you a dish, of my sort."<br>
        <br>
        At half-past eight the Nautilus boat ran softly aground on a heavy<br>
        sand, after having happily passed the coral reef that surrounds the<br>
        Island of Gilboa.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XX<br>
        <br>
        A FEW DAYS ON LAND<br>
        <br>
        I was much impressed on touching land.  Ned Land tried the soil with<br>
        his feet, as if to take possession of it.  However, it was only two<br>
        months before that we had become, according to Captain Nemo,<br>
        "passengers on board the Nautilus," but, in reality, prisoners of its<br>
        commander.<br>
        <br>
        In a few minutes we were within musket-shot of the coast.  The whole<br>
        horizon was hidden behind a beautiful curtain of forests.  Enormous<br>
        trees, the trunks of which attained a height of 200 feet, were tied to<br>
        each other by garlands of bindweed, real natural hammocks, which a<br>
        light breeze rocked.  They were mimosas, figs, hibisci, and palm trees,<br>
        mingled together in profusion; and under the shelter of their verdant<br>
        vault grew orchids, leguminous plants, and ferns.<br>
        <br>
        But, without noticing all these beautiful specimens of Papuan flora,<br>
        the Canadian abandoned the agreeable for the useful.  He discovered a<br>
        coco-tree, beat down some of the fruit, broke them, and we drunk the<br>
        milk and ate the nut with a satisfaction that protested against the<br>
        ordinary food on the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        "Excellent!" said Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        "Exquisite!" replied Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "And I do not think," said the Canadian, "that he would object to our<br>
        introducing a cargo of coco-nuts on board."<br>
        <br>
        "I do not think he would, but he would not taste them."<br>
        <br>
        "So much the worse for him," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "And so much the better for us," replied Ned Land.  "There will be more<br>
        for us."<br>
        <br>
        "One word only, Master Land," I said to the harpooner, who was<br>
        beginning to ravage another coco-nut tree.  "Coco-nuts are good things,<br>
        but before filling the canoe with them it would be wise to reconnoitre<br>
        and see if the island does not produce some substance not less useful.<br>
        Fresh vegetables would be welcome on board the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        "Master is right," replied Conseil; "and I propose to reserve three<br>
        places in our vessel, one for fruits, the other for vegetables, and the<br>
        third for the venison, of which I have not yet seen the smallest<br>
        specimen."<br>
        <br>
        "Conseil, we must not despair," said the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Let us continue," I returned, "and lie in wait.  Although the island<br>
        seems uninhabited, it might still contain some individuals that would<br>
        be less hard than we on the nature of game."<br>
        <br>
        "Ho! ho!" said Ned Land, moving his jaws significantly.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Ned!" said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "My word!" returned the Canadian, "I begin to understand the charms of<br>
        anthropophagy."<br>
        <br>
        "Ned!  Ned! what are you saying?  You, a man-eater? I should not feel<br>
        safe with you, especially as I share your cabin.  I might perhaps wake<br>
        one day to find myself half devoured."<br>
        <br>
        "Friend Conseil, I like you much, but not enough to eat you<br>
        unnecessarily."<br>
        <br>
        "I would not trust you," replied Conseil.  "But enough.  We must<br>
        absolutely bring down some game to satisfy this cannibal, or else one<br>
        of these fine mornings, master will find only pieces of his servant to<br>
        serve him."<br>
        <br>
        While we were talking thus, we were penetrating the sombre arches of<br>
        the forest, and for two hours we surveyed it in all directions.<br>
        <br>
        Chance rewarded our search for eatable vegetables, and one of the most<br>
        useful products of the tropical zones furnished us with precious food<br>
        that we missed on board.  I would speak of the bread-fruit tree, very<br>
        abundant in the island of Gilboa; and I remarked chiefly the variety<br>
        destitute of seeds, which bears in Malaya the name of "rima."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land knew these fruits well.  He had already eaten many during his<br>
        numerous voyages, and he knew how to prepare the eatable substance.<br>
        Moreover, the sight of them excited him, and he could contain himself<br>
        no longer.<br>
        <br>
        "Master," he said, "I shall die if I do not taste a little of this<br>
        bread-fruit pie."<br>
        <br>
        "Taste it, friend Ned--taste it as you want.  We are here to make<br>
        experiments--make them."<br>
        <br>
        "It won't take long," said the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        And, provided with a lentil, he lighted a fire of dead wood that<br>
        crackled joyously.  During this time, Conseil and I chose the best<br>
        fruits of the bread-fruit. Some had not then attained a sufficient<br>
        degree of maturity; and their thick skin covered a white but rather<br>
        fibrous pulp.  Others, the greater number yellow and gelatinous, waited<br>
        only to be picked.<br>
        <br>
        These fruits enclosed no kernel.  Conseil brought a dozen to Ned Land,<br>
        who placed them on a coal fire, after having cut them in thick slices,<br>
        and while doing this repeating:<br>
        <br>
        "You will see, master, how good this bread is.  More so when one has<br>
        been deprived of it so long.  It is not even bread," added he, "but a<br>
        delicate pastry.  You have eaten none, master?"<br>
        <br>
        "No, Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "Very well, prepare yourself for a juicy thing.  If you do not come for<br>
        more, I am no longer the king of harpooners."<br>
        <br>
        After some minutes, the part of the fruits that was exposed to the fire<br>
        was completely roasted.  The interior looked like a white pasty, a sort<br>
        of soft crumb, the flavour of which was like that of an artichoke.<br>
        <br>
        It must be confessed this bread was excellent, and I ate of it with<br>
        great relish.<br>
        <br>
        "What time is it now?" asked the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Two o'clock at least," replied Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "How time flies on firm ground!" sighed Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        "Let us be off," replied Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        We returned through the forest, and completed our collection by a raid<br>
        upon the cabbage-palms, that we gathered from the tops of the trees,<br>
        little beans that I recognised as the "abrou" of the Malays, and yams<br>
        of a superior quality.<br>
        <br>
        We were loaded when we reached the boat.  But Ned Land did not find his<br>
        provisions sufficient.  Fate, however, favoured us.  Just as we were<br>
        pushing off, he perceived several trees, from twenty-five to thirty<br>
        feet high, a species of palm-tree.<br>
        <br>
        At last, at five o'clock in the evening, loaded with our riches, we<br>
        quitted the shore, and half an hour after we hailed the Nautilus.  No<br>
        one appeared on our arrival.  The enormous iron-plated cylinder seemed<br>
        deserted.  The provisions embarked, I descended to my chamber, and<br>
        after supper slept soundly.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, 6th January, nothing new on board.  Not a sound inside,<br>
        not a sign of life.  The boat rested along the edge, in the same place<br>
        in which we had left it.  We resolved to return to the island.  Ned<br>
        Land hoped to be more fortunate than on the day before with regard to<br>
        the hunt, and wished to visit another part of the forest.<br>
        <br>
        At dawn we set off.  The boat, carried on by the waves that flowed to<br>
        shore, reached the island in a few minutes.<br>
        <br>
        We landed, and, thinking that it was better to give in to the Canadian,<br>
        we followed Ned Land, whose long limbs threatened to distance us.  He<br>
        wound up the coast towards the west:  then, fording some torrents, he<br>
        gained the high plain that was bordered with admirable forests.  Some<br>
        kingfishers were rambling along the water-courses, but they would not<br>
        let themselves be approached.  Their circumspection proved to me that<br>
        these birds knew what to expect from bipeds of our species, and I<br>
        concluded that, if the island was not inhabited, at least human beings<br>
        occasionally frequented it.<br>
        <br>
        After crossing a rather large prairie, we arrived at the skirts of a<br>
        little wood that was enlivened by the songs and flight of a large<br>
        number of birds.<br>
        <br>
        "There are only birds," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "But they are eatable," replied the harpooner.<br>
        <br>
        "I do not agree with you, friend Ned, for I see only parrots there."<br>
        <br>
        "Friend Conseil," said Ned, gravely, "the parrot is like pheasant to<br>
        those who have nothing else."<br>
        <br>
        "And," I added, "this bird, suitably prepared, is worth knife and fork."<br>
        <br>
        Indeed, under the thick foliage of this wood, a world of parrots were<br>
        flying from branch to branch, only needing a careful education to speak<br>
        the human language.  For the moment, they were chattering with parrots<br>
        of all colours, and grave cockatoos, who seemed to meditate upon some<br>
        philosophical problem, whilst brilliant red lories passed like a piece<br>
        of bunting carried away by the breeze, papuans, with the finest azure<br>
        colours, and in all a variety of winged things most charming to behold,<br>
        but few eatable.<br>
        <br>
        However, a bird peculiar to these lands, and which has never passed the<br>
        limits of the Arrow and Papuan islands, was wanting in this collection.<br>
        But fortune reserved it for me before long.<br>
        <br>
        After passing through a moderately thick copse, we found a plain<br>
        obstructed with bushes.  I saw then those magnificent birds, the<br>
        disposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the<br>
        wind.  Their undulating flight, graceful aerial curves, and the shading<br>
        of their colours, attracted and charmed one's looks.  I had no trouble<br>
        in recognising them.<br>
        <br>
        "Birds of paradise!"  I exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        The Malays, who carry on a great trade in these birds with the Chinese,<br>
        have several means that we could not employ for taking them.  Sometimes<br>
        they put snares on the top of high trees that the birds of paradise<br>
        prefer to frequent.  Sometimes they catch them with a viscous birdlime<br>
        that paralyses their movements.  They even go so far as to poison the<br>
        fountains that the birds generally drink from.  But we were obliged to<br>
        fire at them during flight, which gave us few chances to bring them<br>
        down; and, indeed, we vainly exhausted one half our ammunition.<br>
        <br>
        About eleven o'clock in the morning, the first range of mountains that<br>
        form the centre of the island was traversed, and we had killed nothing.<br>
        Hunger drove us on.  The hunters had relied on the products of the<br>
        chase, and they were wrong.  Happily Conseil, to his great surprise,<br>
        made a double shot and secured breakfast.  He brought down a white<br>
        pigeon and a wood-pigeon, which, cleverly plucked and suspended from a<br>
        skewer, was roasted before a red fire of dead wood.  While these<br>
        interesting birds were cooking, Ned prepared the fruit of the<br>
        bread-tree. Then the wood-pigeons were devoured to the bones, and<br>
        declared excellent.  The nutmeg, with which they are in the habit of<br>
        stuffing their crops, flavours their flesh and renders it delicious<br>
        eating.<br>
        <br>
        "Now, Ned, what do you miss now?"<br>
        <br>
        "Some four-footed game, M. Aronnax.  All these pigeons are only<br>
        side-dishes and trifles; and until I have killed an animal with cutlets<br>
        I shall not be content."<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site2/page2_2473.html>external_link4_text</a><br><br>
        "Nor I, Ned, if I do not catch a bird of paradise."<br>
        <br>
        "Let us continue hunting," replied Conseil.  "Let us go towards the<br>
        sea.  We have arrived at the first declivities of the mountains, and I<br>
        think we had better regain the region of forests."<br>
        <br>
        That was sensible advice, and was followed out.  After walking for one<br>
        hour we had attained a forest of sago-trees. Some inoffensive serpents<br>
        glided away from us.  The birds of paradise fled at our approach, and<br>
        truly I despaired of getting near one when Conseil, who was walking in<br>
        front, suddenly bent down, uttered a triumphal cry, and came back to me<br>
        bringing a magnificent specimen.<br>
        <br>
        "Ah! bravo, Conseil!"<br>
        <br>
        "Master is very good."<br>
        <br>
        "No, my boy; you have made an excellent stroke.  Take one of these<br>
        living birds, and carry it in your hand."<br>
        <br>
        "If master will examine it, he will see that I have not deserved great<br>
        merit."<br>
        <br>
        "Why, Conseil?"<br>
        <br>
        "Because this bird is as drunk as a quail."<br>
        <br>
        "Drunk!"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir; drunk with the nutmegs that it devoured under the<br>
        nutmeg-tree, under which I found it.  See, friend Ned, see the<br>
        monstrous effects of intemperance!"<br>
        <br>
        "By Jove!" exclaimed the Canadian, "because I have drunk gin for two<br>
        months, you must needs reproach me!"<br>
        <br>
        However, I examined the curious bird.  Conseil was right.  The bird,<br>
        drunk with the juice, was quite powerless.  It could not fly; it could<br>
        hardly walk.<br>
        <br>
        This bird belonged to the most beautiful of the eight species that are<br>
        found in Papua and in the neighbouring islands.  It was the "large<br>
        emerald bird, the most rare kind." It measured three feet in length.<br>
        Its head was comparatively small, its eyes placed near the opening of<br>
        the beak, and also small.  But the shades of colour were beautiful,<br>
        having a yellow beak, brown feet and claws, nut-coloured wings with<br>
        purple tips, pale yellow at the back of the neck and head, and emerald<br>
        colour at the throat, chestnut on the breast and belly.  Two horned,<br>
        downy nets rose from below the tail, that prolonged the long light<br>
        feathers of admirable fineness, and they completed the whole of this<br>
        marvellous bird, that the natives have poetically named the "bird of<br>
        the sun."<br>
        <br>
        But if my wishes were satisfied by the possession of the bird of<br>
        paradise, the Canadian's were not yet.  Happily, about two o'clock, Ned<br>
        Land brought down a magnificent hog; from the brood of those the<br>
        natives call "bari-outang." The animal came in time for us to procure<br>
        real quadruped meat, and he was well received.  Ned Land was very proud<br>
        of his shot.  The hog, hit by the electric ball, fell stone dead.  The<br>
        Canadian skinned and cleaned it properly, after having taken half a<br>
        dozen cutlets, destined to furnish us with a grilled repast in the<br>
        evening.  Then the hunt was resumed, which was still more marked by Ned<br>
        and Conseil's exploits.<br>
        <br>
        Indeed, the two friends, beating the bushes, roused a herd of kangaroos<br>
        that fled and bounded along on their elastic paws.  But these animals<br>
        did not take to flight so rapidly but what the electric capsule could<br>
        stop their course.<br>
        <br>
        "Ah, Professor!" cried Ned Land, who was carried away by the delights<br>
        of the chase, "what excellent game, and stewed, too!  What a supply for<br>
        the Nautilus!  Two! three! five down!  And to think that we shall eat<br>
        that flesh, and that the idiots on board shall not have a crumb!"<br>
        <br>
        I think that, in the excess of his joy, the Canadian, if he had not<br>
        talked so much, would have killed them all.  But he contented himself<br>
        with a single dozen of these interesting marsupians.  These animals<br>
        were small.  They were a species of those "kangaroo rabbits" that live<br>
        habitually in the hollows of trees, and whose speed is extreme; but<br>
        they are moderately fat, and furnish, at least, estimable food.  We<br>
        were very satisfied with the results of the hunt.  Happy Ned proposed<br>
        to return to this enchanting island the next day, for he wished to<br>
        depopulate it of all the eatable quadrupeds.  But he had reckoned<br>
        without his host.<br>
        <br>
        At six o'clock in the evening we had regained the shore; our boat was<br>
        moored to the usual place.  The Nautilus, like a long rock, emerged<br>
        from the waves two miles from the beach.  Ned Land, without waiting,<br>
        occupied himself about the important dinner business.  He understood<br>
        all about cooking well.  The "bari-outang," grilled on the coals, soon<br>
        scented the air with a delicious odour.<br>
        <br>
        Indeed, the dinner was excellent.  Two wood-pigeons completed this<br>
        extraordinary menu.  The sago pasty, the artocarpus bread, some<br>
        mangoes, half a dozen pineapples, and the liquor fermented from some<br>
        coco-nuts, overjoyed us.  I even think that my worthy companions' ideas<br>
        had not all the plainness desirable.<br>
        <br>
        "Suppose we do not return to the Nautilus this evening?" said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Suppose we never return?" added Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        Just then a stone fell at our feet and cut short the harpooner's<br>
        proposition.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XXI<br>
        <br>
        CAPTAIN NEMO'S THUNDERBOLT<br>
        <br>
        We looked at the edge of the forest without rising, my hand stopping in<br>
        the action of putting it to my mouth, Ned Land's completing its office.<br>
        <br>
        "Stones do not fall from the sky," remarked Conseil, "or they would<br>
        merit the name aerolites."<br>
        <br>
        A second stone, carefully aimed, that made a savoury pigeon's leg fall<br>
        from Conseil's hand, gave still more weight to his observation.  We all<br>
        three arose, shouldered our guns, and were ready to reply to any attack.<br>
        <br>
        "Are they apes?" cried Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        "Very nearly--they are savages."<br>
        <br>
        "To the boat!"  I said, hurrying to the sea.<br>
        <br>
        It was indeed necessary to beat a retreat, for about twenty natives<br>
        armed with bows and slings appeared on the skirts of a copse that<br>
        masked the horizon to the right, hardly a hundred steps from us.<br>
        <br>
        Our boat was moored about sixty feet from us.  The savages approached<br>
        us, not running, but making hostile demonstrations.  Stones and arrows<br>
        fell thickly.<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land had not wished to leave his provisions; and, in spite of his<br>
        imminent danger, his pig on one side and kangaroos on the other, he<br>
        went tolerably fast.  In two minutes we were on the shore.  To load the<br>
        boat with provisions and arms, to push it out to sea, and ship the<br>
        oars, was the work of an instant.  We had not gone two cable-lengths,<br>
        when a hundred savages, howling and gesticulating, entered the water up<br>
        to their waists.  I watched to see if their apparition would attract<br>
        some men from the Nautilus on to the platform.  But no.  The enormous<br>
        machine, lying off, was absolutely deserted.<br>
        <br>
        Twenty minutes later we were on board.  The panels were open.  After<br>
        making the boat fast, we entered into the interior of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        I descended to the drawing-room, from whence I heard some chords.<br>
        Captain Nemo was there, bending over his organ, and plunged in a<br>
        musical ecstasy.<br>
        <br>
        "Captain!"<br>
        <br>
        He did not hear me.<br>
        <br>
        "Captain!"  I said, touching his hand.<br>
        <br>
        He shuddered, and, turning round, said, "Ah! it is you, Professor?<br>
        Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes Captain; but we have unfortunately brought a troop of bipeds,<br>
        whose vicinity troubles me."<br>
        <br>
        "What bipeds?"<br>
        <br>
        "Savages."<br>
        <br>
        "Savages!" he echoed, ironically.  "So you are astonished, Professor,<br>
        at having set foot on a strange land and finding savages?  Savages!<br>
        where are there not any?  Besides, are they worse than others, these<br>
        whom you call savages?"<br>
        <br>
        "But Captain----"<br>
        <br>
        "How many have you counted?"<br>
        <br>
        "A hundred at least."<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo, placing his fingers on the organ<br>
        stops, "when all the natives of Papua are assembled on this shore, the<br>
        Nautilus will have nothing to fear from their attacks."<br>
        <br>
        The Captain's fingers were then running over the keys of the<br>
        instrument, and I remarked that he touched only the black keys, which<br>
        gave his melodies an essentially Scotch character.  Soon he had<br>
        forgotten my presence, and had plunged into a reverie that I did not<br>
        disturb.  I went up again on to the platform: night had already fallen;<br>
        for, in this low latitude, the sun sets rapidly and without twilight.<br>
        I could only see the island indistinctly; but the numerous fires,<br>
        lighted on the beach, showed that the natives did not think of leaving<br>
        it.  I was alone for several hours, sometimes thinking of the<br>
        natives--but without any dread of them, for the imperturbable<br>
        confidence of the Captain was catching--sometimes forgetting them to<br>
        admire the splendours of the night in the tropics.  My remembrances<br>
        went to France in the train of those zodiacal stars that would shine in<br>
        some hours' time.  The moon shone in the midst of the constellations of<br>
        the zenith.<br>
        <br>
        The night slipped away without any mischance, the islanders frightened<br>
        no doubt at the sight of a monster aground in the bay.  The panels were<br>
        open, and would have offered an easy access to the interior of the<br>
        Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        At six o'clock in the morning of the 8th January I went up on to the<br>
        platform.  The dawn was breaking.  The island soon showed itself<br>
        through the dissipating fogs, first the shore, then the summits.<br>
        <br>
        The natives were there, more numerous than on the day before--five or<br>
        six hundred perhaps--some of them, profiting by the low water, had come<br>
        on to the coral, at less than two cable-lengths from the Nautilus.  I<br>
        distinguished them easily; they were true Papuans, with athletic<br>
        figures, men of good race, large high foreheads, large, but not broad<br>
        and flat, and white teeth.  Their woolly hair, with a reddish tinge,<br>
        showed off on their black shining bodies like those of the Nubians.<br>
        From the lobes of their ears, cut and distended, hung chaplets of<br>
        bones.  Most of these savages were naked.  Amongst them, I remarked<br>
        some women, dressed from the hips to knees in quite a crinoline of<br>
        herbs, that sustained a vegetable waistband.  Some chiefs had<br>
        ornamented their necks with a crescent and collars of glass beads, red<br>
        and white; nearly all were armed with bows, arrows, and shields and<br>
        carried on their shoulders a sort of net containing those round stones<br>
        which they cast from their slings with great skill.  One of these<br>
        chiefs, rather near to the Nautilus, examined it attentively.  He was,<br>
        perhaps, a "mado" of high rank, for he was draped in a mat of<br>
        banana-leaves, notched round the edges, and set off with brilliant<br>
        colours.<br>
        <br>
        I could easily have knocked down this native, who was within a short<br>
        length; but I thought that it was better to wait for real hostile<br>
        demonstrations.  Between Europeans and savages, it is proper for the<br>
        Europeans to parry sharply, not to attack.<br>
        <br>
        During low water the natives roamed about near the Nautilus, but were<br>
        not troublesome; I heard them frequently repeat the word "Assai," and<br>
        by their gestures I understood that they invited me to go on land, an<br>
        invitation that I declined.<br>
        <br>
        So that, on that day, the boat did not push off, to the great<br>
        displeasure of Master Land, who could not complete his provisions.<br>
        <br>
        This adroit Canadian employed his time in preparing the viands and meat<br>
        that he had brought off the island.  As for the savages, they returned<br>
        to the shore about eleven o'clock in the morning, as soon as the coral<br>
        tops began to disappear under the rising tide; but I saw their numbers<br>
        had increased considerably on the shore.  Probably they came from the<br>
        neighbouring islands, or very likely from Papua.  However, I had not<br>
        seen a single native canoe.  Having nothing better to do, I thought of<br>
        dragging these beautiful limpid waters, under which I saw a profusion<br>
        of shells, zoophytes, and marine plants.  Moreover, it was the last day<br>
        that the Nautilus would pass in these parts, if it float in open sea<br>
        the next day, according to Captain Nemo's promise.<br>
        <br>
        I therefore called Conseil, who brought me a little light drag, very<br>
        like those for the oyster fishery.  Now to work!  For two hours we<br>
        fished unceasingly, but without bringing up any rarities.  The drag was<br>
        filled with midas-ears, harps, melames, and particularly the most<br>
        beautiful hammers I have ever seen.  We also brought up some sea-slugs,<br>
        pearl-oysters, and a dozen little turtles that were reserved for the<br>
        pantry on board.<br>
        <br>
        But just when I expected it least, I put my hand on a wonder, I might<br>
        say a natural deformity, very rarely met with.  Conseil was just<br>
        dragging, and his net came up filled with divers ordinary shells, when,<br>
        all at once, he saw me plunge my arm quickly into the net, to draw out<br>
        a shell, and heard me utter a cry.<br>
        <br>
        "What is the matter, sir?" he asked in surprise.  "Has master been<br>
        bitten?"<br>
        <br>
        "No, my boy; but I would willingly have given a finger for my<br>
        discovery."<br>
        <br>
        "What discovery?"<br>
