        remember my first lessons, and to narrate our adventures in Latin, but<br>
        with no better success.  This last attempt being of no avail, the two<br>
        strangers exchanged some words in their unknown language, and retired.<br>
        <br>
        The door shut.<br>
        <br>
        "It is an infamous shame," cried Ned Land, who broke out for the<br>
        twentieth time.  "We speak to those rogues in French, English, German,<br>
        and Latin, and not one of them has the politeness to answer!"<br>
        <br>
        "Calm yourself," I said to the impetuous Ned; "anger will do no good."<br>
        <br>
        "But do you see, Professor," replied our irascible companion, "that we<br>
        shall absolutely die of hunger in this iron cage?"<br>
        <br>
        "Bah!" said Conseil, philosophically; "we can hold out some time yet."<br>
        <br>
        "My friends," I said, "we must not despair.  We have been worse off<br>
        than this.  Do me the favour to wait a little before forming an opinion<br>
        upon the commander and crew of this boat."<br>
        <br>
        "My opinion is formed," replied Ned Land, sharply.  "They are rascals."<br>
        <br>
        "Good! and from what country?"<br>
        <br>
        "From the land of rogues!"<br>
        <br>
        "My brave Ned, that country is not clearly indicated on the map of the<br>
        world; but I admit that the nationality of the two strangers is hard to<br>
        determine.  Neither English, French, nor German, that is quite certain.<br>
        However, I am inclined to think that the commander and his companion<br>
        were born in low latitudes.  There is southern blood in them.  But I<br>
        cannot decide by their appearance whether they are Spaniards, Turks,<br>
        Arabians, or Indians.  As to their language, it is quite<br>
        incomprehensible."<br>
        <br>
        "There is the disadvantage of not knowing all languages," said Conseil,<br>
        "or the disadvantage of not having one universal language."<br>
        <br>
        As he said these words, the door opened.  A steward entered.  He<br>
        brought us clothes, coats and trousers, made of a stuff I did not know.<br>
        I hastened to dress myself, and my companions followed my example.<br>
        During that time, the steward--dumb, perhaps deaf--had arranged the<br>
        table, and laid three plates.<br>
        <br>
        "This is something like!" said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Bah!" said the angry harpooner, "what do you suppose they eat here?<br>
        Tortoise liver, filleted shark, and beef steaks from seadogs."<br>
        <br>
        "We shall see," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        The dishes, of bell metal, were placed on the table, and we took our<br>
        places.  Undoubtedly we had to do with civilised people, and, had it<br>
        not been for the electric light which flooded us, I could have fancied<br>
        I was in the dining-room of the Adelphi Hotel at Liverpool, or at the<br>
        Grand Hotel in Paris.  I must say, however, that there was neither<br>
        bread nor wine.  The water was fresh and clear, but it was water and<br>
        did not suit Ned Land's taste.  Amongst the dishes which were brought<br>
        to us, I recognised several fish delicately dressed; but of some,<br>
        although excellent, I could give no opinion, neither could I tell to<br>
        what kingdom they belonged, whether animal or vegetable.  As to the<br>
        dinner-service, it was elegant, and in perfect taste.  Each<br>
        utensil--spoon, fork, knife, plate--had a letter engraved on it, with a<br>
        motto above it, of which this is an exact facsimile:<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        MOBILIS IN MOBILI N<br>
        <br>
        The letter N was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical<br>
        person who commanded at the bottom of the seas.<br>
        <br>
        Ned and Conseil did not reflect much.  They devoured the food, and I<br>
        did likewise.  I was, besides, reassured as to our fate; and it seemed<br>
        evident that our hosts would not let us die of want.<br>
        <br>
        However, everything has an end, everything passes away, even the hunger<br>
        of people who have not eaten for fifteen hours.  Our appetites<br>
        satisfied, we felt overcome with sleep.<br>
        <br>
        "Faith!  I shall sleep well," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "So shall I," replied Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        My two companions stretched themselves on the cabin carpet, and were<br>
        soon sound asleep.  For my own part, too many thoughts crowded my<br>
        brain, too many insoluble questions pressed upon me, too many fancies<br>
        kept my eyes half open.  Where were we?  What strange power carried us<br>
        on?  I felt--or rather fancied I felt--the machine sinking down to the<br>
        lowest beds of the sea.  Dreadful nightmares beset me; I saw in these<br>
        mysterious asylums a world of unknown animals, amongst which this<br>
        submarine boat seemed to be of the same kind, living, moving, and<br>
        formidable as they.  Then my brain grew calmer, my imagination wandered<br>
        into vague unconsciousness, and I soon fell into a deep sleep.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER IX<br>
        <br>
        NED LAND'S TEMPERS<br>
        <br>
        How long we slept I do not know; but our sleep must have lasted long,<br>
        for it rested us completely from our fatigues.  I woke first.  My<br>
        companions had not moved, and were still stretched in their corner.<br>
        <br>
        Hardly roused from my somewhat hard couch, I felt my brain freed, my<br>
        mind clear.  I then began an attentive examination of our cell.<br>
        Nothing was changed inside.  The prison was still a prison--the<br>
        prisoners, prisoners.  However, the steward, during our sleep, had<br>
        cleared the table.  I breathed with difficulty.  The heavy air seemed<br>
        to oppress my lungs.  Although the cell was large, we had evidently<br>
        consumed a great part of the oxygen that it contained.  Indeed, each<br>
        man consumes, in one hour, the oxygen contained in more than 176 pints<br>
        of air, and this air, charged (as then) with a nearly equal quantity of<br>
        carbonic acid, becomes unbreathable.<br>
        <br>
        It became necessary to renew the atmosphere of our prison, and no doubt<br>
        the whole in the submarine boat.  That gave rise to a question in my<br>
        mind.  How would the commander of this floating dwelling-place proceed?<br>
        Would he obtain air by chemical means, in getting by heat the oxygen<br>
        contained in chlorate of potash, and in absorbing carbonic acid by<br>
        caustic potash?  Or--a more convenient, economical, and consequently<br>
        more probable alternative--would he be satisfied to rise and take<br>
        breath at the surface of the water, like a whale, and so renew for<br>
        twenty-four hours the atmospheric provision?<br>
        <br>
        In fact, I was already obliged to increase my respirations to eke out<br>
        of this cell the little oxygen it contained, when suddenly I was<br>
        refreshed by a current of pure air, and perfumed with saline<br>
        emanations.  It was an invigorating sea breeze, charged with iodine.  I<br>
        opened my mouth wide, and my lungs saturated themselves with fresh<br>
        particles.<br>
        <br>
        At the same time I felt the boat rolling.  The iron-plated monster had<br>
        evidently just risen to the surface of the ocean to breathe, after the<br>
        fashion of whales.  I found out from that the mode of ventilating the<br>
        boat.<br>
        <br>
        When I had inhaled this air freely, I sought the conduit pipe, which<br>
        conveyed to us the beneficial whiff, and I was not long in finding it.<br>
        Above the door was a ventilator, through which volumes of fresh air<br>
        renewed the impoverished atmosphere of the cell.<br>
        <br>
        I was making my observations, when Ned and Conseil awoke almost at the<br>
        same time, under the influence of this reviving air.  They rubbed their<br>
        eyes, stretched themselves, and were on their feet in an instant.<br>
        <br>
        "Did master sleep well?" asked Conseil, with his usual politeness.<br>
        <br>
        "Very well, my brave boy.  And you, Mr. Land?"<br>
        <br>
        "Soundly, Professor.  But, I don't know if I am right or not, there<br>
        seems to be a sea breeze!"<br>
        <br>
        A seaman could not be mistaken, and I told the Canadian all that had<br>
        passed during his sleep.<br>
        <br>
        "Good!" said he.  "That accounts for those roarings we heard, when the<br>
        supposed narwhal sighted the Abraham Lincoln."<br>
        <br>
        "Quite so, Master Land; it was taking breath."<br>
        <br>
        "Only, Mr. Aronnax, I have no idea what o'clock it is, unless it is<br>
        dinner-time."<br>
        <br>
        "Dinner-time! my good fellow?  Say rather breakfast-time, for we<br>
        certainly have begun another day."<br>
        <br>
        "So," said Conseil, "we have slept twenty-four hours?"<br>
        <br>
        "That is my opinion."<br>
        <br>
        "I will not contradict you," replied Ned Land.  "But, dinner or<br>
        breakfast, the steward will be welcome, whichever he brings."<br>
        <br>
        "Master Land, we must conform to the rules on board, and I suppose our<br>
        appetites are in advance of the dinner hour."<br>
        <br>
        "That is just like you, friend Conseil," said Ned, impatiently.  "You<br>
        are never out of temper, always calm; you would return thanks before<br>
        grace, and die of hunger rather than complain!"<br>
        <br>
        Time was getting on, and we were fearfully hungry; and this time the<br>
        steward did not appear.  It was rather too long to leave us, if they<br>
        really had good intentions towards us.  Ned Land, tormented by the<br>
        cravings of hunger, got still more angry; and, notwithstanding his<br>
        promise, I dreaded an explosion when he found himself with one of the<br>
        crew.<br>
        <br>
        For two hours more Ned Land's temper increased; he cried, he shouted,<br>
        but in vain.  The walls were deaf.  There was no sound to be heard in<br>
        the boat; all was still as death.  It did not move, for I should have<br>
        felt the trembling motion of the hull under the influence of the screw.<br>
        Plunged in the depths of the waters, it belonged no longer to earth:<br>
        this silence was dreadful.<br>
        <br>
        I felt terrified, Conseil was calm, Ned Land roared.<br>
        <br>
        Just then a noise was heard outside.  Steps sounded on the metal flags.<br>
        The locks were turned, the door opened, and the steward appeared.<br>
        <br>
        Before I could rush forward to stop him, the Canadian had thrown him<br>
        down, and held him by the throat.  The steward was choking under the<br>
        grip of his powerful hand.<br>
        <br>
        Conseil was already trying to unclasp the harpooner's hand from his<br>
        half-suffocated victim, and I was going to fly to the rescue, when<br>
        suddenly I was nailed to the spot by hearing these words in French:<br>
        <br>
        "Be quiet, Master Land; and you, Professor, will you be so good as to<br>
        listen to me?"<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER X<br>
        <br>
        THE MAN OF THE SEAS<br>
        <br>
        It was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke.<br>
        <br>
        At these words, Ned Land rose suddenly.  The steward, nearly strangled,<br>
        tottered out on a sign from his master.  But such was the power of the<br>
        commander on board, that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which<br>
        this man must have felt towards the Canadian.  Conseil interested in<br>
        <a href=../site0/page0_6556.html>internal_link0_text</a><br><br>
        spite of himself, I stupefied, awaited in silence the result of this<br>
        scene.<br>
        <br>
        The commander, leaning against the corner of a table with his arms<br>
        folded, scanned us with profound attention.  Did he hesitate to speak?<br>
        Did he regret the words which he had just spoken in French?  One might<br>
        almost think so.<br>
        <br>
        After some moments of silence, which not one of us dreamed of breaking,<br>
        "Gentlemen," said he, in a calm and penetrating voice, "I speak French,<br>
        English, German, and Latin equally well.  I could, therefore, have<br>
        answered you at our first interview, but I wished to know you first,<br>
        then to reflect.  The story told by each one, entirely agreeing in the<br>
        main points, convinced me of your identity.  I know now that chance has<br>
        brought before me M. Pierre Aronnax, Professor of Natural History at<br>
        the Museum of Paris, entrusted with a scientific mission abroad,<br>
        Conseil, his servant, and Ned Land, of Canadian origin, harpooner on<br>
        board the frigate Abraham Lincoln of the navy of the United States of<br>
        America."<br>
        <br>
        I bowed assent.  It was not a question that the commander put to me.<br>
        Therefore there was no answer to be made.  This man expressed himself<br>
        with perfect ease, without any accent.  His sentences were well turned,<br>
        his words clear, and his fluency of speech remarkable.  Yet, I did not<br>
        recognise in him a fellow-countryman.<br>
        <br>
        He continued the conversation in these terms:<br>
        <br>
        "You have doubtless thought, sir, that I have delayed long in paying<br>
        you this second visit.  The reason is that, your identity recognised, I<br>
        wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards you.  I have<br>
        hesitated much.  Most annoying circumstances have brought you into the<br>
        presence of a man who has broken all the ties of humanity.  You have<br>
        come to trouble my existence."<br>
        <br>
        "Unintentionally!" said I.<br>
        <br>
        "Unintentionally?" replied the stranger, raising his voice a little.<br>
        "Was it unintentionally that the Abraham Lincoln pursued me all over<br>
        the seas?  Was it unintentionally that you took passage in this<br>
        frigate?  Was it unintentionally that your cannon-balls rebounded off<br>
        the plating of my vessel?  Was it unintentionally that Mr. Ned Land<br>
        struck me with his harpoon?"<br>
        <br>
        I detected a restrained irritation in these words.  But to these<br>
        recriminations I had a very natural answer to make, and I made it.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said I, "no doubt you are ignorant of the discussions which have<br>
        taken place concerning you in America and Europe.  You do not know that<br>
        divers accidents, caused by collisions with your submarine machine,<br>
        have excited public feeling in the two continents.  I omit the theories<br>
        without number by which it was sought to explain that of which you<br>
        alone possess the secret.  But you must understand that, in pursuing<br>
        you over the high seas of the Pacific, the Abraham Lincoln believed<br>
        itself to be chasing some powerful sea-monster, of which it was<br>
        necessary to rid the ocean at any price."<br>
        <br>
        A half-smile curled the lips of the commander:  then, in a calmer tone:<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax," he replied, "dare you affirm that your frigate would not<br>
        as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster?"<br>
        <br>
        This question embarrassed me, for certainly Captain Farragut might not<br>
        have hesitated.  He might have thought it his duty to destroy a<br>
        contrivance of this kind, as he would a gigantic narwhal.<br>
        <br>
        "You understand then, sir," continued the stranger, "that I have the<br>
        right to treat you as enemies?"<br>
        <br>
        I answered nothing, purposely.  For what good would it be to discuss<br>
        such a proposition, when force could destroy the best arguments?<br>
        <br>
        "I have hesitated some time," continued the commander; "nothing obliged<br>
        me to show you hospitality.  If I chose to separate myself from you, I<br>
        should have no interest in seeing you again; I could place you upon the<br>
        deck of this vessel which has served you as a refuge, I could sink<br>
        beneath the waters, and forget that you had ever existed.  Would not<br>
        that be my right?"<br>
        <br>
        "It might be the right of a savage," I answered, "but not that of a<br>
        civilised man."<br>
        <br>
        "Professor," replied the commander, quickly, "I am not what you call a<br>
        civilised man!  I have done with society entirely, for reasons which I<br>
        alone have the right of appreciating.  I do not, therefore, obey its<br>
        laws, and I desire you never to allude to them before me again!"<br>
        <br>
        This was said plainly.  A flash of anger and disdain kindled in the<br>
        eyes of the Unknown, and I had a glimpse of a terrible past in the life<br>
        of this man.  Not only had he put himself beyond the pale of human<br>
        laws, but he had made himself independent of them, free in the<br>
        strictest acceptation of the word, quite beyond their reach!  Who then<br>
        would dare to pursue him at the bottom of the sea, when, on its<br>
        surface, he defied all attempts made against him?<br>
        <br>
        What vessel could resist the shock of his submarine monitor?  What<br>
        cuirass, however thick, could withstand the blows of his spur?  No man<br>
        could demand from him an account of his actions; God, if he believed in<br>
        one--his conscience, if he had one--were the sole judges to whom he was<br>
        answerable.<br>
        <br>
        These reflections crossed my mind rapidly, whilst the stranger<br>
        personage was silent, absorbed, and as if wrapped up in himself.  I<br>
        regarded him with fear mingled with interest, as, doubtless, OEdiphus<br>
        regarded the Sphinx.<br>
        <br>
        After rather a long silence, the commander resumed the conversation.<br>
        <br>
        "I have hesitated," said he, "but I have thought that my interest might<br>
        be reconciled with that pity to which every human being has a right.<br>
        You will remain on board my vessel, since fate has cast you there.  You<br>
        will be free; and, in exchange for this liberty, I shall only impose<br>
        one single condition.  Your word of honour to submit to it will<br>
        suffice."<br>
        <br>
        "Speak, sir," I answered.  "I suppose this condition is one which a man<br>
        of honour may accept?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir; it is this:  It is possible that certain events, unforeseen,<br>
        may oblige me to consign you to your cabins for some hours or some<br>
        days, as the case may be.  As I desire never to use violence, I expect<br>
        from you, more than all the others, a passive obedience.  In thus<br>
        acting, I take all the responsibility:  I acquit you entirely, for I<br>
        make it an impossibility for you to see what ought not to be seen.  Do<br>
        you accept this condition?"<br>
        <br>
        Then things took place on board which, to say the least, were singular,<br>
        and which ought not to be seen by people who were not placed beyond the<br>
        pale of social laws.  Amongst the surprises which the future was<br>
        preparing for me, this might not be the least.<br>
        <br>
        "We accept," I answered; "only I will ask your permission, sir, to<br>
        address one question to you--one only."<br>
        <br>
        "Speak, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "You said that we should be free on board."<br>
        <br>
        "Entirely."<br>
        <br>
        "I ask you, then, what you mean by this liberty?"<br>
        <br>
        "Just the liberty to go, to come, to see, to observe even all that<br>
        passes here save under rare circumstances--the liberty, in short, which<br>
        we enjoy ourselves, my companions and I."<br>
        <br>
        It was evident that we did not understand one another.<br>
        <br>
        "Pardon me, sir," I resumed, "but this liberty is only what every<br>
        prisoner has of pacing his prison.  It cannot suffice us."<br>
        <br>
        "It must suffice you, however."<br>
        <br>
        "What! we must renounce for ever seeing our country, our friends, our<br>
        relations again?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir.  But to renounce that unendurable worldly yoke which men<br>
        believe to be liberty is not perhaps so painful as you think."<br>
        <br>
        "Well," exclaimed Ned Land, "never will I give my word of honour not to<br>
        try to escape."<br>
        <br>
        "I did not ask you for your word of honour, Master Land," answered the<br>
        commander, coldly.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," I replied, beginning to get angry in spite of my self, "you<br>
        abuse your situation towards us; it is cruelty."<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir, it is clemency.  You are my prisoners of war.  I keep you,<br>
        when I could, by a word, plunge you into the depths of the ocean.  You<br>
        attacked me.  You came to surprise a secret which no man in the world<br>
        must penetrate--the secret of my whole existence.  And you think that I<br>
        am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?<br>
        Never!  In retaining you, it is not you whom I guard--it is myself."<br>
        <br>
        These words indicated a resolution taken on the part of the commander,<br>
        against which no arguments would prevail.<br>
        <br>
        "So, sir," I rejoined, "you give us simply the choice between life and<br>
        death?"<br>
        <br>
        "Simply."<br>
        <br>
        "My friends," said I, "to a question thus put, there is nothing to<br>
        answer.  But no word of honour binds us to the master of this vessel."<br>
        <br>
        "None, sir," answered the Unknown.<br>
        <br>
        Then, in a gentler tone, he continued:<br>
        <br>
        "Now, permit me to finish what I have to say to you.  I know you, M.<br>
        Aronnax.  You and your companions will not, perhaps, have so much to<br>
        complain of in the chance which has bound you to my fate.  You will<br>
        find amongst the books which are my favourite study the work which you<br>
        have published on `the depths of the sea.'  I have often read it.  You<br>
        have carried out your work as far as terrestrial science permitted you.<br>
        But you do not know all--you have not seen all.  Let me tell you then,<br>
        Professor, that you will not regret the time passed on board my vessel.<br>
        You are going to visit the land of marvels."<br>
        <br>
        These words of the commander had a great effect upon me.  I cannot deny<br>
        it.  My weak point was touched; and I forgot, for a moment, that the<br>
        contemplation of these sublime subjects was not worth the loss of<br>
        liberty.  Besides, I trusted to the future to decide this grave<br>
        question.  So I contented myself with saying:<br>
        <br>
        "By what name ought I to address you?"<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," replied the commander, "I am nothing to you but Captain Nemo;<br>
        and you and your companions are nothing to me but the passengers of the<br>
        Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo called.  A steward appeared.  The captain gave him his<br>
        orders in that strange language which I did not understand.  Then,<br>
        turning towards the Canadian and Conseil:<br>
        <br>
        "A repast awaits you in your cabin," said he.  "Be so good as to follow<br>
        this man.<br>
        <br>
        "And now, M. Aronnax, our breakfast is ready.  Permit me to lead the<br>
        way."<br>
        <br>
        "I am at your service, Captain."<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site1/page1_6843.html>external_link1_text</a><br><br>
        I followed Captain Nemo; and as soon as I had passed through the door,<br>
        I found myself in a kind of passage lighted by electricity, similar to<br>
        the waist of a ship.  After we had proceeded a dozen yards, a second<br>
        door opened before me.<br>
        <br>
        I then entered a dining-room, decorated and furnished in severe taste.<br>
        High oaken sideboards, inlaid with ebony, stood at the two extremities<br>
        of the room, and upon their shelves glittered china, porcelain, and<br>
        glass of inestimable value.  The plate on the table sparkled in the<br>
        rays which the luminous ceiling shed around, while the light was<br>
        tempered and softened by exquisite paintings.<br>
        <br>
        In the centre of the room was a table richly laid out.  Captain Nemo<br>
        indicated the place I was to occupy.<br>
        <br>
        The breakfast consisted of a certain number of dishes, the contents of<br>
        which were furnished by the sea alone; and I was ignorant of the nature<br>
        and mode of preparation of some of them.  I acknowledged that they were<br>
        good, but they had a peculiar flavour, which I easily became accustomed<br>
        to.  These different aliments appeared to me to be rich in phosphorus,<br>
        and I thought they must have a marine origin.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo looked at me.  I asked him no questions, but he guessed my<br>
        thoughts, and answered of his own accord the questions which I was<br>
        burning to address to him.<br>
        <br>
        "The greater part of these dishes are unknown to you," he said to me.<br>
        "However, you may partake of them without fear.  They are wholesome and<br>
        nourishing.  For a long time I have renounced the food of the earth,<br>
        and I am never ill now.  My crew, who are healthy, are fed on the same<br>
        food."<br>
        <br>
        "So," said I, "all these eatables are the produce of the sea?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Professor, the sea supplies all my wants.  Sometimes I cast my<br>
        nets in tow, and I draw them in ready to break.  Sometimes I hunt in<br>
        the midst of this element, which appears to be inaccessible to man, and<br>
        quarry the game which dwells in my submarine forests.  My flocks, like<br>
        those of Neptune's old shepherds, graze fearlessly in the immense<br>
        prairies of the ocean.  I have a vast property there, which I cultivate<br>
        myself, and which is always sown by the hand of the Creator of all<br>
        things."<br>
        <br>
        "I can understand perfectly, sir, that your nets furnish excellent fish<br>
        for your table; I can understand also that you hunt aquatic game in<br>
        your submarine forests; but I cannot understand at all how a particle<br>
        of meat, no matter how small, can figure in your bill of fare."<br>
        <br>
        "This, which you believe to be meat, Professor, is nothing else than<br>
        fillet of turtle.  Here are also some dolphins' livers, which you take<br>
        to be ragout of pork.  My cook is a clever fellow, who excels in<br>
        dressing these various products of the ocean.  Taste all these dishes.<br>
        Here is a preserve of sea-cucumber, which a Malay would declare to be<br>
        unrivalled in the world; here is a cream, of which the milk has been<br>
        furnished by the cetacea, and the sugar by the great fucus of the North<br>
        Sea; and, lastly, permit me to offer you some preserve of anemones,<br>
        which is equal to that of the most delicious fruits."<br>
        <br>
        I tasted, more from curiosity than as a connoisseur, whilst Captain<br>
        Nemo enchanted me with his extraordinary stories.<br>
        <br>
        "You like the sea, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes; I love it!  The sea is everything.  It covers seven tenths of the<br>
        terrestrial globe.  Its breath is pure and healthy.  It is an immense<br>
        desert, where man is never lonely, for he feels life stirring on all<br>
        sides.  The sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful<br>
        existence.  It is nothing but love and emotion; it is the `Living<br>
        Infinite,' as one of your poets has said.  In fact, Professor, Nature<br>
        manifests herself in it by her three kingdoms--mineral, vegetable, and<br>
        animal.  The sea is the vast reservoir of Nature.  The globe began with<br>
        sea, so to speak; and who knows if it will not end with it?  In it is<br>
        supreme tranquillity.  The sea does not belong to despots.  Upon its<br>
        surface men can still exercise unjust laws, fight, tear one another to<br>
        pieces, and be carried away with terrestrial horrors.  But at thirty<br>
        feet below its level, their reign ceases, their influence is quenched,<br>
        and their power disappears.  Ah! sir, live--live in the bosom of the<br>
        waters!  There only is independence!  There I recognise no masters!<br>
        There I am free!"<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo suddenly became silent in the midst of this enthusiasm, by<br>
        which he was quite carried away.  For a few moments he paced up and<br>
        down, much agitated.  Then he became more calm, regained his accustomed<br>
        coldness of expression, and turning towards me:<br>
        <br>
        "Now, Professor," said he, "if you wish to go over the Nautilus, I am<br>
        at your service."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo rose.  I followed him.  A double door, contrived at the<br>
        back of the dining-room, opened, and I entered a room equal in<br>
        dimensions to that which I had just quitted.<br>
        <br>
        It was a library.  High pieces of furniture, of black violet ebony<br>
        inlaid with brass, supported upon their wide shelves a great number of<br>
        books uniformly bound.  They followed the shape of the room,<br>
        terminating at the lower part in huge divans, covered with brown<br>
        leather, which were curved, to afford the greatest comfort.  Light<br>
        movable desks, made to slide in and out at will, allowed one to rest<br>
        one's book while reading.  In the centre stood an immense table,<br>
        covered with pamphlets, amongst which were some newspapers, already of<br>
        old date.  The electric light flooded everything; it was shed from four<br>
        unpolished globes half sunk in the volutes of the ceiling.  I looked<br>
        with real admiration at this room, so ingeniously fitted up, and I<br>
        could scarcely believe my eyes.<br>
        <br>
        "Captain Nemo," said I to my host, who had just thrown himself on one<br>
        of the divans, "this is a library which would do honour to more than<br>
        one of the continental palaces, and I am absolutely astounded when I<br>
        consider that it can follow you to the bottom of the seas."<br>
        <br>
        "Where could one find greater solitude or silence, Professor?" replied<br>
        Captain Nemo.  "Did your study in the Museum afford you such perfect<br>
        quiet?"<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir; and I must confess that it is a very poor one after yours.<br>
        You must have six or seven thousand volumes here."<br>
        <br>
        "Twelve thousand, M. Aronnax.  These are the only ties which bind me to<br>
        the earth.  But I had done with the world on the day when my Nautilus<br>
        plunged for the first time beneath the waters.  That day I bought my<br>
        last volumes, my last pamphlets, my last papers, and from that time I<br>
        wish to think that men no longer think or write.  These books,<br>
        Professor, are at your service besides, and you can make use of them<br>
        freely."<br>
        <br>
        I thanked Captain Nemo, and went up to the shelves of the library.<br>
        Works on science, morals, and literature abounded in every language;<br>
        but I did not see one single work on political economy; that subject<br>
        appeared to be strictly proscribed.  Strange to say, all these books<br>
        were irregularly arranged, in whatever language they were written; and<br>
        this medley proved that the Captain of the Nautilus must have read<br>
        indiscriminately the books which he took up by chance.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said I to the Captain, "I thank you for having placed this<br>
        library at my disposal.  It contains treasures of science, and I shall<br>
        profit by them."<br>
        <br>
        "This room is not only a library," said Captain Nemo, "it is also a<br>
        smoking-room."<br>
        <br>
        "A smoking-room!" I cried.  "Then one may smoke on board?"<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly."<br>
        <br>
        "Then, sir, I am forced to believe that you have kept up a<br>
        communication with Havannah."<br>
        <br>
        "Not any," answered the Captain.  "Accept this cigar, M. Aronnax; and,<br>
        though it does not come from Havannah, you will be pleased with it, if<br>
        you are a connoisseur."<br>
        <br>
        I took the cigar which was offered me; its shape recalled the London<br>
        ones, but it seemed to be made of leaves of gold.  I lighted it at a<br>
        little brazier, which was supported upon an elegant bronze stem, and<br>
        drew the first whiffs with the delight of a lover of smoking who has<br>
        not smoked for two days.<br>
        <br>
        "It is excellent, but it is not tobacco."<br>
        <br>
        "No!" answered the Captain, "this tobacco comes neither from Havannah<br>
        nor from the East.  It is a kind of sea-weed, rich in nicotine, with<br>
        which the sea provides me, but somewhat sparingly."<br>
        <br>
        At that moment Captain Nemo opened a door which stood opposite to that<br>
        by which I had entered the library, and I passed into an immense<br>
        drawing-room splendidly lighted.<br>
        <br>
        It was a vast, four-sided room, thirty feet long, eighteen wide, and<br>
        fifteen high.  A luminous ceiling, decorated with light arabesques,<br>
        shed a soft clear light over all the marvels accumulated in this<br>
        museum.  For it was in fact a museum, in which an intelligent and<br>
        prodigal hand had gathered all the treasures of nature and art, with<br>
        the artistic confusion which distinguishes a painter's studio.<br>
        <br>
        Thirty first-rate pictures, uniformly framed, separated by bright<br>
        drapery, ornamented the walls, which were hung with tapestry of severe<br>
        design. I saw works of great value, the greater part of which I had<br>
        admired in the special collections of Europe, and in the exhibitions of<br>
        paintings. The several schools of the old masters were represented by a<br>
        Madonna of Raphael, a Virgin of Leonardo da Vinci, a nymph of Corregio,<br>
        a woman of Titan, an Adoration of Veronese, an Assumption of Murillo, a<br>
        portrait of Holbein, a monk of Velasquez, a martyr of Ribera, a fair of<br>
        Rubens, two Flemish landscapes of Teniers, three little "genre"<br>
        pictures of Gerard Dow, Metsu, and Paul Potter, two specimens of<br>
        Gericault and Prudhon, and some sea-pieces of Backhuysen and Vernet.<br>
        Amongst the works of modern painters were pictures with the signatures<br>
        of Delacroix, Ingres, Decamps, Troyon, Meissonier, Daubigny, etc.; and<br>
        some admirable statues in marble and bronze, after the finest antique<br>
        models, stood upon pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum.<br>
        Amazement, as the Captain of the Nautilus had predicted, had already<br>
        begun to take possession of me.<br>
        <br>
        "Professor," said this strange man, "you must excuse the unceremonious<br>
        way in which I receive you, and the disorder of this room."<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," I answered, "without seeking to know who you are, I recognise in<br>
        you an artist."<br>
        <br>
        "An amateur, nothing more, sir.  Formerly I loved to collect these<br>
        beautiful works created by the hand of man.  I sought them greedily,<br>
        and ferreted them out indefatigably, and I have been able to bring<br>
        together some objects of great value.  These are my last souvenirs of<br>
        that world which is dead to me.  In my eyes, your modern artists are<br>
        already old; they have two or three thousand years of existence; I<br>
        confound them in my own mind.  Masters have no age."<br>
        <br>
        "And these musicians?" said I, pointing out some works of Weber,<br>
        Rossini, Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, Meyerbeer, Herold, Wagner, Auber,<br>
        Gounod, and a number of others, scattered over a large model<br>
        piano-organ which occupied one of the panels of the drawing-room.<br>
        <br>
        "These musicians," replied Captain Nemo, "are the contemporaries of<br>
        Orpheus; for in the memory of the dead all chronological differences<br>
        are effaced; and I am dead, Professor; as much dead as those of your<br>
        friends who are sleeping six feet under the earth!"<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo was silent, and seemed lost in a profound reverie. I<br>
        contemplated him with deep interest, analysing in silence the strange<br>
        expression of his countenance. Leaning on his elbow against an angle of<br>
        a costly mosaic table, he no longer saw me,--he had forgotten my<br>
        presence.<br>
        <br>
        I did not disturb this reverie, and continued my observation of the<br>
        curiosities which enriched this drawing-room.<br>
        <a href=../site2/page2_5918.html>external_link2_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        Under elegant glass cases, fixed by copper rivets, were classed and<br>
        labelled the most precious productions of the sea which had ever been<br>
        presented to the eye of a naturalist.  My delight as a professor may be<br>
        conceived.<br>
        <br>
        The division containing the zoophytes presented the most curious<br>
        specimens of the two groups of polypi and echinodermes. In the first<br>
        group, the tubipores, were gorgones arranged like a fan, soft sponges<br>
        of Syria, ises of the Moluccas, pennatules, an admirable virgularia of<br>
        the Norwegian seas, variegated unbellulairae, alcyonariae, a whole<br>
        series of madrepores, which my master Milne Edwards has so cleverly<br>
        classified, amongst which I remarked some wonderful flabellinae<br>
        oculinae of the Island of Bourbon, the "Neptune's car" of the Antilles,<br>
        superb varieties of corals--in short, every species of those curious<br>
        polypi of which entire islands are formed, which will one day become<br>
        continents. Of the echinodermes, remarkable for their coating of<br>
        spines, asteri, sea-stars, pantacrinae, comatules, asterophons, echini,<br>
        holothuri, etc., represented individually a complete collection of this<br>
        group.<br>
        <br>
        A somewhat nervous conchyliologist would certainly have fainted before<br>
        other more numerous cases, in which were classified the specimens of<br>
        molluscs. It was a collection of inestimable value, which time fails me<br>
        to describe minutely. Amongst these specimens I will quote from memory<br>
        only the elegant royal hammer-fish of the Indian Ocean, whose regular<br>
        white spots stood out brightly on a red and brown ground, an imperial<br>
        spondyle, bright-coloured, bristling with spines, a rare specimen in<br>
        the European museums--(I estimated its value at not less than L1000); a<br>
        common hammer-fish of the seas of New Holland, which is only procured<br>
        with difficulty; exotic buccardia of Senegal; fragile white bivalve<br>
        shells, which a breath might shatter like a soap-bubble; several<br>
        varieties of the aspirgillum of Java, a kind of calcareous tube, edged<br>
        with leafy folds, and much debated by amateurs; a whole series of<br>
        trochi, some a greenish-yellow, found in the American seas, others a<br>
        reddish-brown, natives of Australian waters; others from the Gulf of<br>
        Mexico, remarkable for their imbricated shell; stellari found in the<br>
        Southern Seas; and last, the rarest of all, the magnificent spur of New<br>
        Zealand; and every description of delicate and fragile shells to which<br>
        science has given appropriate names.<br>
        <br>
        Apart, in separate compartments, were spread out chaplets of pearls of<br>
        the greatest beauty, which reflected the electric light in little<br>
        sparks of fire; pink pearls, torn from the pinna-marina of the Red Sea;<br>
        green pearls of the haliotyde iris; yellow, blue and black pearls, the<br>
        curious productions of the divers molluscs of every ocean, and certain<br>
        mussels of the water-courses of the North; lastly, several specimens of<br>
        inestimable value which had been gathered from the rarest pintadines.<br>
        Some of these pearls were larger than a pigeon's egg, and were worth as<br>
        much, and more than that which the traveller Tavernier sold to the Shah<br>
        of Persia for three millions, and surpassed the one in the possession<br>
        of the Imaum of Muscat, which I had believed to be unrivalled in the<br>
        world.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, to estimate the value of this collection was simply<br>
        impossible.  Captain Nemo must have expended millions in the<br>
        acquirement of these various specimens, and I was thinking what source<br>
        he could have drawn from, to have been able thus to gratify his fancy<br>
        for collecting, when I was interrupted by these words:<br>
        <br>
        "You are examining my shells, Professor?  Unquestionably they must be<br>
        interesting to a naturalist; but for me they have a far greater charm,<br>
        for I have collected them all with my own hand, and there is not a sea<br>
        on the face of the globe which has escaped my researches."<br>
        <br>
        "I can understand, Captain, the delight of wandering about in the midst<br>
        of such riches.  You are one of those who have collected their<br>
        treasures themselves.  No museum in Europe possesses such a collection<br>
        of the produce of the ocean.  But if I exhaust all my admiration upon<br>
        it, I shall have none left for the vessel which carries it.  I do not<br>
        wish to pry into your secrets:  but I must confess that this Nautilus,<br>
        with the motive power which is confined in it, the contrivances which<br>
        enable it to be worked, the powerful agent which propels it, all excite<br>
        my curiosity to the highest pitch.  I see suspended on the walls of<br>
        this room instruments of whose use I am ignorant."<br>
        <br>
        "You will find these same instruments in my own room, Professor, where<br>
        I shall have much pleasure in explaining their use to you.  But first<br>
        come and inspect the cabin which is set apart for your own use.  You<br>
        must see how you will be accommodated on board the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        I followed Captain Nemo who, by one of the doors opening from each<br>
        panel of the drawing-room, regained the waist.  He conducted me towards<br>
        the bow, and there I found, not a cabin, but an elegant room, with a<br>
        bed, dressing-table, and several other pieces of excellent furniture.<br>
        <br>
        I could only thank my host.<br>
        <br>
        "Your room adjoins mine," said he, opening a door, "and mine opens into<br>
        the drawing-room that we have just quitted."<br>
        <br>
        I entered the Captain's room:  it had a severe, almost a monkish<br>
        aspect.  A small iron bedstead, a table, some articles for the toilet;<br>
        the whole lighted by a skylight.  No comforts, the strictest<br>
        necessaries only.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo pointed to a seat.<br>
        <br>
        "Be so good as to sit down," he said.  I seated myself, and he began<br>
        thus:<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XI<br>
        <br>
        ALL BY ELECTRICITY<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said Captain Nemo, showing me the instruments hanging on the<br>
        walls of his room, "here are the contrivances required for the<br>
        navigation of the Nautilus.  Here, as in the drawing-room, I have them<br>
        always under my eyes, and they indicate my position and exact direction<br>
        in the middle of the ocean.  Some are known to you, such as the<br>
        thermometer, which gives the internal temperature of the Nautilus; the<br>
        barometer, which indicates the weight of the air and foretells the<br>
        changes of the weather; the hygrometer, which marks the dryness of the<br>
        atmosphere; the storm-glass, the contents of which, by decomposing,<br>
        announce the approach of tempests; the compass, which guides my course;<br>
        the sextant, which shows the latitude by the altitude of the sun;<br>
        chronometers, by which I calculate the longitude; and glasses for day<br>
        and night, which I use to examine the points of the horizon, when the<br>
        Nautilus rises to the surface of the waves."<br>
        <br>
        "These are the usual nautical instruments," I replied, "and I know the<br>
        use of them.  But these others, no doubt, answer to the particular<br>
        requirements of the Nautilus.  This dial with movable needle is a<br>
        manometer, is it not?"<br>
        <br>
        "It is actually a manometer.  But by communication with the water,<br>
        whose external pressure it indicates, it gives our depth at the same<br>
        time."<br>
        <br>
        "And these other instruments, the use of which I cannot guess?"<br>
        <br>
        "Here, Professor, I ought to give you some explanations.  Will you be<br>
        kind enough to listen to me?"<br>
        <br>
        He was silent for a few moments, then he said:<br>
        <br>
        "There is a powerful agent, obedient, rapid, easy, which conforms to<br>
        every use, and reigns supreme on board my vessel.  Everything is done<br>
        by means of it.  It lights, warms it, and is the soul of my mechanical<br>
        apparatus.  This agent is electricity."<br>
        <br>
        "Electricity?"  I cried in surprise.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "Nevertheless, Captain, you possess an extreme rapidity of movement,<br>
        which does not agree well with the power of electricity.  Until now,<br>
        its dynamic force has remained under restraint, and has only been able<br>
        to produce a small amount of power."<br>
        <br>
        "Professor," said Captain Nemo, "my electricity is not everybody's.<br>
        You know what sea-water is composed of.  In a thousand grammes are<br>
        found 96 1/2 per cent. of water, and about 2 2/3 per cent.  of chloride<br>
        of sodium; then, in a smaller quantity, chlorides of magnesium and of<br>
        potassium, bromide of magnesium, sulphate of magnesia, sulphate and<br>
        carbonate of lime.  You see, then, that chloride of sodium forms a<br>
        large part of it.  So it is this sodium that I extract from the<br>
        sea-water, and of which I compose my ingredients.  I owe all to the<br>
        ocean; it produces electricity, and electricity gives heat, light,<br>
        motion, and, in a word, life to the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        "But not the air you breathe?"<br>
        <br>
        "Oh!  I could manufacture the air necessary for my consumption, but it<br>
        is useless, because I go up to the surface of the water when I please.<br>
        However, if electricity does not furnish me with air to breathe, it<br>
        works at least the powerful pumps that are stored in spacious<br>
        reservoirs, and which enable me to prolong at need, and as long as I<br>
        will, my stay in the depths of the sea.  It gives a uniform and<br>
        unintermittent light, which the sun does not.  Now look at this clock;<br>
        it is electrical, and goes with a regularity that defies the best<br>
        chronometers.  I have divided it into twenty-four hours, like the<br>
        Italian clocks, because for me there is neither night nor day, sun nor<br>
        moon, but only that factitious light that I take with me to the bottom<br>
        of the sea.  Look! just now, it is ten o'clock in the morning."<br>
        <br>
        "Exactly."<br>
        <br>
        "Another application of electricity.  This dial hanging in front of us<br>
        indicates the speed of the Nautilus.  An electric thread puts it in<br>
        communication with the screw, and the needle indicates the real speed.<br>
        Look! now we are spinning along with a uniform speed of fifteen miles<br>
        an hour."<br>
        <br>
        "It is marvelous!  And I see, Captain, you were right to make use of<br>
        this agent that takes the place of wind, water, and steam."<br>
        <br>
        "We have not finished, M. Aronnax," said Captain Nemo, rising.  "If you<br>
        will allow me, we will examine the stern of the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        Really, I knew already the anterior part of this submarine boat, of<br>
        which this is the exact division, starting from the ship's head: the<br>
        dining-room, five yards long, separated from the library by a<br>
        water-tight partition; the library, five yards long; the large<br>
        drawing-room, ten yards long, separated from the Captain's room by a<br>
        second water-tight partition; the said room, five yards in length;<br>
        mine, two and a half yards; and, lastly a reservoir of air, seven and a<br>
        half yards, that extended to the bows.  Total length thirty five yards,<br>
        or one hundred and five feet.  The partitions had doors that were shut<br>
        hermetically by means of india-rubber instruments, and they ensured the<br>
        safety of the Nautilus in case of a leak.<br>
        <br>
        I followed Captain Nemo through the waist, and arrived at the centre of<br>
        the boat.  There was a sort of well that opened between two partitions.<br>
        An iron ladder, fastened with an iron hook to the partition, led to the<br>
        upper end.  I asked the Captain what the ladder was used for.<br>
        <br>
        "It leads to the small boat," he said.<br>
        <br>
        "What! have you a boat?"  I exclaimed, in surprise.<br>
        <br>
        "Of course; an excellent vessel, light and insubmersible, that serves<br>
        either as a fishing or as a pleasure boat."<br>
        <br>
        "But then, when you wish to embark, you are obliged to come to the<br>
        surface of the water?"<br>
        <br>
        "Not at all.  This boat is attached to the upper part of the hull of<br>
        the Nautilus, and occupies a cavity made for it.  It is decked, quite<br>
        water-tight, and held together by solid bolts.  This ladder leads to a<br>
        man-hole made in the hull of the Nautilus, that corresponds with a<br>
        similar hole made in the side of the boat.  By this double opening I<br>
        <a href=../site2/page2_2475.html>external_link3_text</a><br><br>
        get into the small vessel.  They shut the one belonging to the<br>
        Nautilus; I shut the other by means of screw pressure.  I undo the<br>
        bolts, and the little boat goes up to the surface of the sea with<br>
        prodigious rapidity.  I then open the panel of the bridge, carefully<br>
        shut till then; I mast it, hoist my sail, take my oars, and I'm off."<br>
        <br>
        "But how do you get back on board?"<br>
        <br>
        "I do not come back, M. Aronnax; the Nautilus comes to me."<br>
        <br>
        "By your orders?"<br>
        <br>
        "By my orders.  An electric thread connects us.  I telegraph to it, and<br>
        that is enough."<br>
        <br>
        "Really," I said, astonished at these marvels, "nothing can be more<br>
        simple."<br>
        <br>
        After having passed by the cage of the staircase that led to the<br>
        platform, I saw a cabin six feet long, in which Conseil and Ned Land,<br>
        enchanted with their repast, were devouring it with avidity.  Then a<br>
        door opened into a kitchen nine feet long, situated between the large<br>
        store-rooms. There electricity, better than gas itself, did all the<br>
        cooking.  The streams under the furnaces gave out to the sponges of<br>
        platina a heat which was regularly kept up and distributed.  They also<br>
        heated a distilling apparatus, which, by evaporation, furnished<br>
        excellent drinkable water.  Near this kitchen was a bathroom<br>
        comfortably furnished, with hot and cold water taps.<br>
        <br>
        Next to the kitchen was the berth-room of the vessel, sixteen feet<br>
        long.  But the door was shut, and I could not see the management of it,<br>
        which might have given me an idea of the number of men employed on<br>
        board the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        At the bottom was a fourth partition that separated this office from<br>
        the engine-room. A door opened, and I found myself in the compartment<br>
        where Captain Nemo--certainly an engineer of a very high order--had<br>
        arranged his locomotive machinery.  This engine-room, clearly lighted,<br>
        did not measure less than sixty-five feet in length.  It was divided<br>
        into two parts; the first contained the materials for producing<br>
        electricity, and the second the machinery that connected it with the<br>
        screw.  I examined it with great interest, in order to understand the<br>
        machinery of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        "You see," said the Captain, "I use Bunsen's contrivances, not<br>
        Ruhmkorff's. Those would not have been powerful enough.  Bunsen's are<br>
        fewer in number, but strong and large, which experience proves to be<br>
        the best.  The electricity produced passes forward, where it works, by<br>
        electro-magnets of great size, on a system of levers and cog-wheels<br>
        that transmit the movement to the axle of the screw.  This one, the<br>
        diameter of which is nineteen feet, and the thread twenty-three feet,<br>
        performs about 120 revolutions in a second."<br>
        <br>
        "And you get then?"<br>
        <br>
        "A speed of fifty miles an hour."<br>
        <br>
        "I have seen the Nautilus manoeuvre before the Abraham Lincoln, and I<br>
        have my own ideas as to its speed.  But this is not enough.  We must<br>
        see where we go.  We must be able to direct it to the right, to the<br>
        left, above, below.  How do you get to the great depths, where you find<br>
        an increasing resistance, which is rated by hundreds of atmospheres?<br>
        How do you return to the surface of the ocean?  And how do you maintain<br>
        yourselves in the requisite medium?  Am I asking too much?"<br>
        <br>
        "Not at all, Professor," replied the Captain, with some hesitation;<br>
        "since you may never leave this submarine boat.  Come into the saloon,<br>
        it is our usual study, and there you will learn all you want to know<br>
        about the Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XII<br>
        <br>
        SOME FIGURES<br>
        <br>
        A moment after we were seated on a divan in the saloon smoking.  The<br>
        Captain showed me a sketch that gave the plan, section, and elevation<br>
        of the Nautilus.  Then he began his description in these words:<br>
        <br>
        "Here, M. Aronnax, are the several dimensions of the boat you are in.<br>
        It is an elongated cylinder with conical ends.  It is very like a cigar<br>
        in shape, a shape already adopted in London in several constructions of<br>
        the same sort.  The length of this cylinder, from stem to stern, is<br>
        exactly 232 feet, and its maximum breadth is twenty-six feet.  It is<br>
        not built quite like your long-voyage steamers, but its lines are<br>
        sufficiently long, and its curves prolonged enough, to allow the water<br>
        to slide off easily, and oppose no obstacle to its passage.  These two<br>
        dimensions enable you to obtain by a simple calculation the surface and<br>
        cubic contents of the Nautilus.  Its area measures 6,032 feet; and its<br>
        contents about 1,500 cubic yards; that is to say, when completely<br>
        immersed it displaces 50,000 feet of water, or weighs 1,500 tons.<br>
        <br>
        "When I made the plans for this submarine vessel, I meant that<br>
        nine-tenths should be submerged:  consequently it ought only to<br>
        displace nine-tenths of its bulk, that is to say, only to weigh that<br>
        number of tons.  I ought not, therefore, to have exceeded that weight,<br>
        constructing it on the aforesaid dimensions.<br>
        <br>
        "The Nautilus is composed of two hulls, one inside, the other outside,<br>
        joined by T-shaped irons, which render it very strong.  Indeed, owing<br>
        to this cellular arrangement it resists like a block, as if it were<br>
        solid.  Its sides cannot yield; it coheres spontaneously, and not by<br>
        the closeness of its rivets; and its perfect union of the materials<br>
        enables it to defy the roughest seas.<br>
        <br>
        "These two hulls are composed of steel plates, whose density is from .7<br>
        to .8 that of water.  The first is not less than two inches and a half<br>
        thick and weighs 394 tons.  The second envelope, the keel, twenty<br>
        inches high and ten thick, weighs only sixty-two tons.  The engine, the<br>
        ballast, the several accessories and apparatus appendages, the<br>
        partitions and bulkheads, weigh 961.62 tons.  Do you follow all this?"<br>
        <br>
        "I do."<br>
        <br>
        "Then, when the Nautilus is afloat under these circumstances, one-tenth<br>
        is out of the water.  Now, if I have made reservoirs of a size equal to<br>
        this tenth, or capable of holding 150 tons, and if I fill them with<br>
        water, the boat, weighing then 1,507 tons, will be completely immersed.<br>
        That would happen, Professor.  These reservoirs are in the lower part<br>
        of the Nautilus.  I turn on taps and they fill, and the vessel sinks<br>
        that had just been level with the surface."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Captain, but now we come to the real difficulty.  I can<br>
        understand your rising to the surface; but, diving below the surface,<br>
        does not your submarine contrivance encounter a pressure, and<br>
        consequently undergo an upward thrust of one atmosphere for every<br>
        thirty feet of water, just about fifteen pounds per square inch?"<br>
        <br>
        "Just so, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "Then, unless you quite fill the Nautilus, I do not see how you can<br>
        draw it down to those depths."<br>
        <br>
        "Professor, you must not confound statics with dynamics or you will be<br>
        exposed to grave errors.  There is very little labour spent in<br>
        attaining the lower regions of the ocean, for all bodies have a<br>
        tendency to sink.  When I wanted to find out the necessary increase of<br>
        weight required to sink the Nautilus, I had only to calculate the<br>
        reduction of volume that sea-water acquires according to the depth."<br>
        <br>
        "That is evident."<br>
        <br>
        "Now, if water is not absolutely incompressible, it is at least capable<br>
        of very slight compression.  Indeed, after the most recent calculations<br>
        this reduction is only .000436 of an atmosphere for each thirty feet of<br>
        depth.  If we want to sink 3,000 feet, I should keep account of the<br>
        reduction of bulk under a pressure equal to that of a column of water<br>
        of a thousand feet.  The calculation is easily verified.  Now, I have<br>
        supplementary reservoirs capable of holding a hundred tons.  Therefore<br>
        I can sink to a considerable depth.  When I wish to rise to the level<br>
        of the sea, I only let off the water, and empty all the reservoirs if I<br>
        want the Nautilus to emerge from the tenth part of her total capacity."<br>
        <br>
        I had nothing to object to these reasonings.<br>
        <br>
        "I admit your calculations, Captain," I replied; "I should be wrong to<br>
        dispute them since daily experience confirms them; but I foresee a real<br>
        difficulty in the way."<br>
        <br>
        "What, sir?"<br>
        <br>
        "When you are about 1,000 feet deep, the walls of the Nautilus bear a<br>
        pressure of 100 atmospheres.  If, then, just now you were to empty the<br>
        supplementary reservoirs, to lighten the vessel, and to go up to the<br>
        surface, the pumps must overcome the pressure of 100 atmospheres, which<br>
        is 1,500 lbs.  per square inch.  From that a power----"<br>
        <br>
        "That electricity alone can give," said the Captain, hastily.  "I<br>
        repeat, sir, that the dynamic power of my engines is almost infinite.<br>
        The pumps of the Nautilus have an enormous power, as you must have<br>
        observed when their jets of water burst like a torrent upon the Abraham<br>
        Lincoln.  Besides, I use subsidiary reservoirs only to attain a mean<br>
        depth of 750 to 1,000 fathoms, and that with a view of managing my<br>
        machines.  Also, when I have a mind to visit the depths of the ocean<br>
        five or six mlles below the surface, I make use of slower but not less<br>
        infallible means."<br>
        <br>
        "What are they, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "That involves my telling you how the Nautilus is worked."<br>
        <br>
        "I am impatient to learn."<br>
        <br>
        "To steer this boat to starboard or port, to turn, in a word, following<br>
        a horizontal plan, I use an ordinary rudder fixed on the back of the<br>
        stern-post, and with one wheel and some tackle to steer by.  But I can<br>
        also make the Nautilus rise and sink, and sink and rise, by a vertical<br>
        movement by means of two inclined planes fastened to its sides,<br>
        opposite the centre of flotation, planes that move in every direction,<br>
        and that are worked by powerful levers from the interior.  If the<br>
        planes are kept parallel with the boat, it moves horizontally.  If<br>
        slanted, the Nautilus, according to this inclination, and under the<br>
        influence of the screw, either sinks diagonally or rises diagonally as<br>
        it suits me.  And even if I wish to rise more quickly to the surface, I<br>
        ship the screw, and the pressure of the water causes the Nautilus to<br>
        rise vertically like a balloon filled with hydrogen."<br>
        <br>
        "Bravo, Captain!  But how can the steersman follow the route in the<br>
        middle of the waters?"<br>
        <br>
        "The steersman is placed in a glazed box, that is raised about the hull<br>
        of the Nautilus, and furnished with lenses."<br>
        <br>
        "Are these lenses capable of resisting such pressure?"<br>
        <br>
        "Perfectly.  Glass, which breaks at a blow, is, nevertheless, capable<br>
        of offering considerable resistance.  During some experiments of<br>
        fishing by electric light in 1864 in the Northern Seas, we saw plates<br>
        less than a third of an inch thick resist a pressure of sixteen<br>
        atmospheres.  Now, the glass that I use is not less than thirty times<br>
        thicker."<br>
        <br>
        "Granted.  But, after all, in order to see, the light must exceed the<br>
        darkness, and in the midst of the darkness in the water, how can you<br>
        see?"<br>
        <br>
        "Behind the steersman's cage is placed a powerful electric reflector,<br>
        the rays from which light up the sea for half a mile in front."<br>
        <br>
        "Ah! bravo, bravo, Captain!  Now I can account for this phosphorescence<br>
        in the supposed narwhal that puzzled us so.  I now ask you if the<br>
        boarding of the Nautilus and of the Scotia, that has made such a noise,<br>
        has been the result of a chance rencontre?"<br>
        <a href=../site0/page0_1420.html>internal_link4_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        "Quite accidental, sir.  I was sailing only one fathom below the<br>
        surface of the water when the shock came.  It had no bad result."<br>
        <br>
        "None, sir.  But now, about your rencontre with the Abraham Lincoln?"<br>
        <br>
        "Professor, I am sorry for one of the best vessels in the American<br>
        navy; but they attacked me, and I was bound to defend myself.  I<br>
        contented myself, however, with putting the frigate hors de combat; she<br>
        will not have any difficulty in getting repaired at the next port."<br>
        <br>
        "Ah, Commander! your Nautilus is certainly a marvellous boat."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Professor; and I love it as if it were part of myself.  If danger<br>
        threatens one of your vessels on the ocean, the first impression is the<br>
        feeling of an abyss above and below.  On the Nautilus men's hearts<br>
        never fail them.  No defects to be afraid of, for the double shell is<br>
        as firm as iron; no rigging to attend to; no sails for the wind to<br>
        carry away; no boilers to burst; no fire to fear, for the vessel is<br>
        made of iron, not of wood; no coal to run short, for electricity is the<br>
        only mechanical agent; no collision to fear, for it alone swims in deep<br>
        water; no tempest to brave, for when it dives below the water it<br>
        reaches absolute tranquillity.  There, sir! that is the perfection of<br>
        vessels!  And if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in<br>
        the vessel than the builder, and the builder than the captain himself,<br>
        you understand the trust I repose in my Nautilus; for I am at once<br>
        captain, builder, and engineer."<br>
        <br>
        "But how could you construct this wonderful Nautilus in secret?"<br>
        <br>
        "Each separate portion, M. Aronnax, was brought from different parts of<br>
        the globe."<br>
        <br>
        "But these parts had to be put together and arranged?"<br>
        <br>
        "Professor, I had set up my workshops upon a desert island in the<br>
        ocean.  There my workmen, that is to say, the brave men that I<br>
        instructed and educated, and myself have put together our Nautilus.<br>
        Then, when the work was finished, fire destroyed all trace of our<br>
        proceedings on this island, that I could have jumped over if I had<br>
        liked."<br>
        <br>
        "Then the cost of this vessel is great?"<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax, an iron vessel costs L145 per ton.  Now the Nautilus<br>
        weighed 1,500. It came therefore to L67,500, and L80,000 more for<br>
        fitting it up, and about L200,000, with the works of art and the<br>
        collections it contains."<br>
        <br>
        "One last question, Captain Nemo."<br>
        <br>
        "Ask it, Professor."<br>
        <br>
        "You are rich?"<br>
        <br>
        "Immensely rich, sir; and I could, without missing it, pay the national<br>
        debt of France."<br>
        <br>
        I stared at the singular person who spoke thus.  Was he playing upon my<br>
        credulity?  The future would decide that.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XIII<br>
        <br>
        THE BLACK RIVER<br>
        <br>
        The portion of the terrestrial globe which is covered by water is<br>
        estimated at upwards of eighty millions of acres.  This fluid mass<br>
        comprises two billions two hundred and fifty millions of cubic miles,<br>
        forming a spherical body of a diameter of sixty leagues, the weight of<br>
        which would be three quintillions of tons.  To comprehend the meaning<br>
        of these figures, it is necessary to observe that a quintillion is to a<br>
        billion as a billion is to unity; in other words, there are as many<br>
        billions in a quintillion as there are units in a billion.  This mass<br>
        of fluid is equal to about the quantity of water which would be<br>
        discharged by all the rivers of the earth in forty thousand years.<br>
        <br>
        During the geological epochs the ocean originally prevailed everywhere.<br>
        Then by degrees, in the silurian period, the tops of the mountains<br>
        began to appear, the islands emerged, then disappeared in partial<br>
        deluges, reappeared, became settled, formed continents, till at length<br>
        the earth became geographically arranged, as we see in the present day.<br>
        The solid had wrested from the liquid thirty-seven million six hundred<br>
        and fifty-seven square miles, equal to twelve billions nine hundred and<br>
        sixty millions of acres.<br>
        <br>
        The shape of continents allows us to divide the waters into five great<br>
        portions:  the Arctic or Frozen Ocean, the Antarctic, or Frozen Ocean,<br>
        the Indian, the Atlantic, and the Pacific Oceans.<br>
        <br>
        The Pacific Ocean extends from north to south between the two Polar<br>
        Circles, and from east to west between Asia and America, over an extent<br>
        of 145 degrees of longitude.  It is the quietest of seas; its currents<br>
        are broad and slow, it has medium tides, and abundant rain.  Such was<br>
        the ocean that my fate destined me first to travel over under these<br>
        strange conditions.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said Captain Nemo, "we will, if you please, take our bearings<br>
        and fix the starting-point of this voyage.  It is a quarter to twelve;<br>
        I will go up again to the surface."<br>
        <br>
        The Captain pressed an electric clock three times.  The pumps began to<br>
        drive the water from the tanks; the needle of the manometer marked by a<br>
        different pressure the ascent of the Nautilus, then it stopped.<br>
        <br>
        "We have arrived," said the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        I went to the central staircase which opened on to the platform,<br>
        clambered up the iron steps, and found myself on the upper part of the<br>
        Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        The platform was only three feet out of water.  The front and back of<br>
        the Nautilus was of that spindle-shape which caused it justly to be<br>
        compared to a cigar.  I noticed that its iron plates, slightly<br>
        overlaying each other, resembled the shell which clothes the bodies of<br>
        our large terrestrial reptiles.  It explained to me how natural it was,<br>
        in spite of all glasses, that this boat should have been taken for a<br>
        marine animal.<br>
        <br>
        Toward the middle of the platform the longboat, half buried in the hull<br>
        of the vessel, formed a slight excrescence.  Fore and aft rose two<br>
        cages of medium height with inclined sides, and partly closed by thick<br>
        lenticular glasses; one destined for the steersman who directed the<br>
        Nautilus, the other containing a brilliant lantern to give light on the<br>
        road.<br>
        <br>
        The sea was beautiful, the sky pure.  Scarcely could the long vehicle<br>
        feel the broad undulations of the ocean.  A light breeze from the east<br>
        rippled the surface of the waters.  The horizon, free from fog, made<br>
        observation easy.  Nothing was in sight.  Not a quicksand, not an<br>
        island.  A vast desert.<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo, by the help of his sextant, took the altitude of the sun,<br>
        which ought also to give the latitude.  He waited for some moments till<br>
        its disc touched the horizon.  Whilst taking observations not a muscle<br>
        moved, the instrument could not have been more motionless in a hand of<br>
        marble.<br>
        <br>
        "Twelve o'clock, sir," said he.  "When you like----"<br>
        <br>
        I cast a last look upon the sea, slightly yellowed by the Japanese<br>
        coast, and descended to the saloon.<br>
        <br>
        "And now, sir, I leave you to your studies," added the Captain; "our<br>
        course is E.N.E., our depth is twenty-six fathoms.  Here are maps on a<br>
        large scale by which you may follow it.  The saloon is at your<br>
        disposal, and, with your permission, I will retire."  Captain Nemo<br>
        bowed, and I remained alone, lost in thoughts all bearing on the<br>
        commander of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        For a whole hour was I deep in these reflections, seeking to pierce<br>
        this mystery so interesting to me.  Then my eyes fell upon the vast<br>
        planisphere spread upon the table, and I placed my finger on the very<br>
        spot where the given latitude and longitude crossed.<br>
        <br>
        The sea has its large rivers like the continents.  They are special<br>
        currents known by their temperature and their colour.  The most<br>
        remarkable of these is known by the name of the Gulf Stream.  Science<br>
        has decided on the globe the direction of five principal currents: one<br>
        in the North Atlantic, a second in the South, a third in the North<br>
        Pacific, a fourth in the South, and a fifth in the Southern Indian<br>
        Ocean.  It is even probable that a sixth current existed at one time or<br>
        another in the Northern Indian Ocean, when the Caspian and Aral Seas<br>
        formed but one vast sheet of water.<br>
        <br>
        At this point indicated on the planisphere one of these currents was<br>
        rolling, the Kuro-Scivo of the Japanese, the Black River, which,<br>
        leaving the Gulf of Bengal, where it is warmed by the perpendicular<br>
        rays of a tropical sun, crosses the Straits of Malacca along the coast<br>
        of Asia, turns into the North Pacific to the Aleutian Islands, carrying<br>
        with it trunks of camphor-trees and other indigenous productions, and<br>
        edging the waves of the ocean with the pure indigo of its warm water.<br>
        It was this current that the Nautilus was to follow.  I followed it<br>
        with my eye; saw it lose itself in the vastness of the Pacific, and<br>
        felt myself drawn with it, when Ned Land and Conseil appeared at the<br>
        door of the saloon.<br>
        <br>
        My two brave companions remained petrified at the sight of the wonders<br>
        spread before them.<br>
        <br>
        "Where are we, where are we?" exclaimed the Canadian.  "In the museum<br>
        at Quebec?"<br>
        <br>
        "My friends," I answered, making a sign for them to enter, "you are not<br>
        in Canada, but on board the Nautilus, fifty yards below the level of<br>
        the sea."<br>
        <br>
        "But, M. Aronnax," said Ned Land, "can you tell me how many men there<br>
        are on board?  Ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred?"<br>
        <br>
        "I cannot answer you, Mr. Land; it is better to abandon for a time all<br>
        idea of seizing the Nautilus or escaping from it.  This ship is a<br>
        masterpiece of modern industry, and I should be sorry not to have seen<br>
        it.  Many people would accept the situation forced upon us, if only to<br>
        move amongst such wonders.  So be quiet and let us try and see what<br>
        passes around us."<br>
        <br>
        "See!" exclaimed the harpooner, "but we can see nothing in this iron<br>
        prison!  We are walking--we are sailing--blindly."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land had scarcely pronounced these words when all was suddenly<br>
        darkness.  The luminous ceiling was gone, and so rapidly that my eyes<br>
        received a painful impression.<br>
        <br>
        We remained mute, not stirring, and not knowing what surprise awaited<br>
        us, whether agreeable or disagreeable.  A sliding noise was heard: one<br>
        would have said that panels were working at the sides of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        "It is the end of the end!" said Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        Suddenly light broke at each side of the saloon, through two oblong<br>
        openings.  The liquid mass appeared vividly lit up by the electric<br>
        gleam.  Two crystal plates separated us from the sea.  At first I<br>
        trembled at the thought that this frail partition might break, but<br>
        strong bands of copper bound them, giving an almost infinite power of<br>
        resistance.<br>
        <br>
        The sea was distinctly visible for a mile all round the Nautilus.  What<br>
        a spectacle!  What pen can describe it?  Who could paint the effects of<br>
        the light through those transparent sheets of water, and the softness<br>
        of the successive gradations from the lower to the superior strata of<br>
        the ocean?<br>
        <br>
