        enormous head occupies one-third of its entire body.  Better armed than<br>
        the whale, whose upper jaw is furnished only with whalebone, it is<br>
        supplied with twenty-five large tusks, about eight inches long,<br>
        cylindrical and conical at the top, each weighing two pounds.  It is in<br>
        the upper part of this enormous head, in great cavities divided by<br>
        cartilages, that is to be found from six to eight hundred pounds of<br>
        that precious oil called spermaceti.  The cachalot is a disagreeable<br>
        creature, more tadpole than fish, according to Fredol's description.<br>
        It is badly formed, the whole of its left side being (if we may say<br>
        it), a "failure," and being only able to see with its right eye.  But<br>
        the formidable troop was nearing us.  They had seen the whales and were<br>
        preparing to attack them.  One could judge beforehand that the<br>
        cachalots would be victorious, not only because they were better built<br>
        for attack than their inoffensive adversaries, but also because they<br>
        could remain longer under water without coming to the surface.  There<br>
        was only just time to go to the help of the whales.  The Nautilus went<br>
        under water.  Conseil, Ned Land, and I took our places before the<br>
        window in the saloon, and Captain Nemo joined the pilot in his cage to<br>
        work his apparatus as an engine of destruction.  Soon I felt the<br>
        beatings of the screw quicken, and our speed increased.  The battle<br>
        between the cachalots and the whales had already begun when the<br>
        Nautilus arrived.  They did not at first show any fear at the sight of<br>
        this new monster joining in the conflict.  But they soon had to guard<br>
        against its blows.  What a battle!  The Nautilus was nothing but a<br>
        formidable harpoon, brandished by the hand of its Captain.  It hurled<br>
        itself against the fleshy mass, passing through from one part to the<br>
        other, leaving behind it two quivering halves of the animal.  It could<br>
        not feel the formidable blows from their tails upon its sides, nor the<br>
        shock which it produced itself, much more.  One cachalot killed, it ran<br>
        at the next, tacked on the spot that it might not miss its prey, going<br>
        forwards and backwards, answering to its helm, plunging when the<br>
        cetacean dived into the deep waters, coming up with it when it returned<br>
        to the surface, striking it front or sideways, cutting or tearing in<br>
        all directions and at any pace, piercing it with its terrible spur.<br>
        What carnage!  What a noise on the surface of the waves!  What sharp<br>
        hissing, and what snorting peculiar to these enraged animals!  In the<br>
        midst of these waters, generally so peaceful, their tails made perfect<br>
        billows.  For one hour this wholesale massacre continued, from which<br>
        the cachalots could not escape.  Several times ten or twelve united<br>
        tried to crush the Nautilus by their weight.  From the window we could<br>
        see their enormous mouths, studded with tusks, and their formidable<br>
        eyes.  Ned Land could not contain himself; he threatened and swore at<br>
        them.  We could feel them clinging to our vessel like dogs worrying a<br>
        wild boar in a copse.  But the Nautilus, working its screw, carried<br>
        them here and there, or to the upper levels of the ocean, without<br>
        caring for their enormous weight, nor the powerful strain on the<br>
        vessel.  At length the mass of cachalots broke up, the waves became<br>
        quiet, and I felt that we were rising to the surface.  The panel<br>
        opened, and we hurried on to the platform.  The sea was covered with<br>
        mutilated bodies.  A formidable explosion could not have divided and<br>
        torn this fleshy mass with more violence.  We were floating amid<br>
        gigantic bodies, bluish on the back and white underneath, covered with<br>
        enormous protuberances.  Some terrified cachalots were flying towards<br>
        the horizon.  The waves were dyed red for several miles, and the<br>
        Nautilus floated in a sea of blood:  Captain Nemo joined us.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Master Land?" said he.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, sir," replied the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had somewhat<br>
        calmed; "it is a terrible spectacle, certainly.  But I am not a<br>
        butcher.  I am a hunter, and I call this a butchery."<br>
        <br>
        "It is a massacre of mischievous creatures," replied the Captain; "and<br>
        the Nautilus is not a butcher's knife."<br>
        <br>
        "I like my harpoon better," said the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Every one to his own," answered the Captain, looking fixedly at Ned<br>
        Land.<br>
        <br>
        I feared he would commit some act of violence, which would end in sad<br>
        consequences.  But his anger was turned by the sight of a whale which<br>
        the Nautilus had just come up with.  The creature had not quite escaped<br>
        from the cachalot's teeth.  I recognised the southern whale by its flat<br>
        head, which is entirely black.  Anatomically, it is distinguished from<br>
        the white whale and the North Cape whale by the seven cervical<br>
        vertebrae, and it has two more ribs than its congeners.  The<br>
        unfortunate cetacean was lying on its side, riddled with holes from the<br>
        bites, and quite dead.  From its mutilated fin still hung a young whale<br>
        which it could not save from the massacre.  Its open mouth let the<br>
        water flow in and out, murmuring like the waves breaking on the shore.<br>
        Captain Nemo steered close to the corpse of the creature.  Two of his<br>
        men mounted its side, and I saw, not without surprise, that they were<br>
        drawing from its breasts all the milk which they contained, that is to<br>
        say, about two or three tons.  The Captain offered me a cup of the<br>
        milk, which was still warm.  I could not help showing my repugnance to<br>
        the drink; but he assured me that it was excellent, and not to be<br>
        distinguished from cow's milk.  I tasted it, and was of his opinion.<br>
        It was a useful reserve to us, for in the shape of salt butter or<br>
        cheese it would form an agreeable variety from our ordinary food.  From<br>
        that day I noticed with uneasiness that Ned Land's ill-will towards<br>
        Captain Nemo increased, and I resolved to watch the Canadian's gestures<br>
        closely.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XIII<br>
        <br>
        THE ICEBERG<br>
        <br>
        The Nautilus was steadily pursuing its southerly course, following the<br>
        fiftieth meridian with considerable speed.  Did he wish to reach the<br>
        pole?  I did not think so, for every attempt to reach that point had<br>
        hitherto failed.  Again, the season was far advanced, for in the<br>
        Antarctic regions the 13th of March corresponds with the 13th of<br>
        September of northern regions, which begin at the equinoctial season.<br>
        On the 14th of March I saw floating ice in latitude 55°, merely<br>
        pale bits of debris from twenty to twenty-five feet long, forming banks<br>
        over which the sea curled.  The Nautilus remained on the surface of the<br>
        ocean.  Ned Land, who had fished in the Arctic Seas, was familiar with<br>
        its icebergs; but Conseil and I admired them for the first time.  In<br>
        the atmosphere towards the southern horizon stretched a white dazzling<br>
        band.  English whalers have given it the name of "ice blink."  However<br>
        thick the clouds may be, it is always visible, and announces the<br>
        presence of an ice pack or bank.  Accordingly, larger blocks soon<br>
        appeared, whose brilliancy changed with the caprices of the fog.  Some<br>
        of these masses showed green veins, as if long undulating lines had<br>
        been traced with sulphate of copper; others resembled enormous<br>
        amethysts with the light shining through them.  Some reflected the<br>
        light of day upon a thousand crystal facets.  Others shaded with vivid<br>
        calcareous reflections resembled a perfect town of marble.  The more we<br>
        neared the south the more these floating islands increased both in<br>
        number and importance.<br>
        <br>
        At 60° lat. every pass had disappeared.  But, seeking carefully,<br>
        Captain Nemo soon found a narrow opening, through which he boldly<br>
        slipped, knowing, however, that it would close behind him.  Thus,<br>
        guided by this clever hand, the Nautilus passed through all the ice<br>
        with a precision which quite charmed Conseil; icebergs or mountains,<br>
        ice-fields or smooth plains, seeming to have no limits, drift-ice or<br>
        floating ice-packs, plains broken up, called palchs when they are<br>
        circular, and streams when they are made up of long strips.  The<br>
        temperature was very low; the thermometer exposed to the air marked 2<br>
        deg. or 3° below zero, but we were warmly clad with fur, at the<br>
        expense of the sea-bear and seal.  The interior of the Nautilus, warmed<br>
        regularly by its electric apparatus, defied the most intense cold.<br>
        Besides, it would only have been necessary to go some yards beneath the<br>
        waves to find a more bearable temperature.  Two months earlier we<br>
        should have had perpetual daylight in these latitudes; but already we<br>
        had had three or four hours of night, and by and by there would be six<br>
        months of darkness in these circumpolar regions.  On the 15th of March<br>
        we were in the latitude of New Shetland and South Orkney.  The Captain<br>
        told me that formerly numerous tribes of seals inhabited them; but that<br>
        English and American whalers, in their rage for destruction, massacred<br>
        both old and young; thus, where there was once life and animation, they<br>
        had left silence and death.<br>
        <br>
        About eight o'clock on the morning of the 16th of March the Nautilus,<br>
        following the fifty-fifth meridian, cut the Antarctic polar circle.<br>
        Ice surrounded us on all sides, and closed the horizon.  But Captain<br>
        Nemo went from one opening to another, still going higher.  I cannot<br>
        express my astonishment at the beauties of these new regions.  The ice<br>
        took most surprising forms.  Here the grouping formed an oriental town,<br>
        with innumerable mosques and minarets; there a fallen city thrown to<br>
        the earth, as it were, by some convulsion of nature.  The whole aspect<br>
        was constantly changed by the oblique rays of the sun, or lost in the<br>
        greyish fog amidst hurricanes of snow.  Detonations and falls were<br>
        heard on all sides, great overthrows of icebergs, which altered the<br>
        whole landscape like a diorama.  Often seeing no exit, I thought we<br>
        were definitely prisoners; but, instinct guiding him at the slightest<br>
        indication, Captain Nemo would discover a new pass.  He was never<br>
        mistaken when he saw the thin threads of bluish water trickling along<br>
        the ice-fields; and I had no doubt that he had already ventured into<br>
        the midst of these Antarctic seas before.  On the 16th of March,<br>
        however, the ice-fields absolutely blocked our road.  It was not the<br>
        iceberg itself, as yet, but vast fields cemented by the cold.  But this<br>
        obstacle could not stop Captain Nemo: he hurled himself against it with<br>
        frightful violence.  The Nautilus entered the brittle mass like a<br>
        wedge, and split it with frightful crackings.  It was the battering ram<br>
        of the ancients hurled by infinite strength.  The ice, thrown high in<br>
        the air, fell like hail around us.  By its own power of impulsion our<br>
        apparatus made a canal for itself; some times carried away by its own<br>
        impetus, it lodged on the ice-field, crushing it with its weight, and<br>
        sometimes buried beneath it, dividing it by a simple pitching movement,<br>
        producing large rents in it.  Violent gales assailed us at this time,<br>
        accompanied by thick fogs, through which, from one end of the platform<br>
        to the other, we could see nothing.  The wind blew sharply from all<br>
        parts of the compass, and the snow lay in such hard heaps that we had<br>
        to break it with blows of a pickaxe.  The temperature was always at 5<br>
        deg. below zero; every outward part of the Nautilus was covered with<br>
        ice.  A rigged vessel would have been entangled in the blocked up<br>
        gorges.  A vessel without sails, with electricity for its motive power,<br>
        and wanting no coal, could alone brave such high latitudes.  At length,<br>
        on the 18th of March, after many useless assaults, the Nautilus was<br>
        positively blocked.  It was no longer either streams, packs, or<br>
        ice-fields, but an interminable and immovable barrier, formed by<br>
        mountains soldered together.<br>
        <br>
        "An iceberg!" said the Canadian to me.<br>
        <br>
        I knew that to Ned Land, as well as to all other navigators who had<br>
        preceded us, this was an inevitable obstacle.  The sun appearing for an<br>
        instant at noon, Captain Nemo took an observation as near as possible,<br>
        which gave our situation at 51° 30' long. and 67° 39' of S.<br>
        lat.  We had advanced one degree more in this Antarctic region.  Of the<br>
        liquid surface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse.  Under the<br>
        spur of the Nautilus lay stretched a vast plain, entangled with<br>
        confused blocks.  Here and there sharp points and slender needles<br>
        rising to a height of 200 feet; further on a steep shore, hewn as it<br>
        were with an axe and clothed with greyish tints; huge mirrors,<br>
        reflecting a few rays of sunshine, half drowned in the fog.  And over<br>
        this desolate face of nature a stern silence reigned, scarcely broken<br>
        by the flapping of the wings of petrels and puffins.  Everything was<br>
        frozen--even the noise.  The Nautilus was then obliged to stop in its<br>
        adventurous course amid these fields of ice.  In spite of our efforts,<br>
        in spite of the powerful means employed to break up the ice, the<br>
        Nautilus remained immovable.  Generally, when we can proceed no<br>
        further, we have return still open to us; but here return was as<br>
        impossible as advance, for every pass had closed behind us; and for the<br>
        few moments when we were stationary, we were likely to be entirely<br>
        blocked, which did indeed happen about two o'clock in the afternoon,<br>
        the fresh ice forming around its sides with astonishing rapidity.  I<br>
        was obliged to admit that Captain Nemo was more than imprudent.  I was<br>
        on the platform at that moment.  The Captain had been observing our<br>
        situation for some time past, when he said to me:<br>
        <br>
        "Well, sir, what do you think of this?"<br>
        <br>
        "I think that we are caught, Captain."<br>
        <br>
        "So, M. Aronnax, you really think that the Nautilus cannot disengage<br>
        itself?"<br>
        <br>
        "With difficulty, Captain; for the season is already too far advanced<br>
        for you to reckon on the breaking of the ice."<br>
        <br>
        "Ah! sir," said Captain Nemo, in an ironical tone, "you will always be<br>
        the same.  You see nothing but difficulties and obstacles.  I affirm<br>
        that not only can the Nautilus disengage itself, but also that it can<br>
        go further still."<br>
        <br>
        "Further to the South?"  I asked, looking at the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir; it shall go to the pole."<br>
        <br>
        "To the pole!"  I exclaimed, unable to repress a gesture of incredulity.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," replied the Captain, coldly, "to the Antarctic pole--to that<br>
        unknown point from whence springs every meridian of the globe.  You<br>
        know whether I can do as I please with the Nautilus!"<br>
        <br>
        Yes, I knew that.  I knew that this man was bold, even to rashness.<br>
        But to conquer those obstacles which bristled round the South Pole,<br>
        rendering it more inaccessible than the North, which had not yet been<br>
        reached by the boldest navigators--was it not a mad enterprise, one<br>
        which only a maniac would have conceived?  It then came into my head to<br>
        ask Captain Nemo if he had ever discovered that pole which had never<br>
        yet been trodden by a human creature?<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir," he replied; "but we will discover it together.  Where others<br>
        have failed, I will not fail.  I have never yet led my Nautilus so far<br>
        into southern seas; but, I repeat, it shall go further yet."<br>
        <br>
        "I can well believe you, Captain," said I, in a slightly ironical tone.<br>
        "I believe you!  Let us go ahead!  There are no obstacles for us!  Let<br>
        us smash this iceberg!  Let us blow it up; and, if it resists, let us<br>
        give the Nautilus wings to fly over it!"<br>
        <br>
        "Over it, sir!" said Captain Nemo, quietly; "no, not over it, but under<br>
        it!"<br>
        <br>
        "Under it!"  I exclaimed, a sudden idea of the Captain's projects<br>
        flashing upon my mind.  I understood; the wonderful qualities of the<br>
        Nautilus were going to serve us in this superhuman enterprise.<br>
        <br>
        "I see we are beginning to understand one another, sir," said the<br>
        Captain, half smiling.  "You begin to see the possibility--I should say<br>
        the success--of this attempt.  That which is impossible for an ordinary<br>
        vessel is easy to the Nautilus.  If a continent lies before the pole,<br>
        it must stop before the continent; but if, on the contrary, the pole is<br>
        washed by open sea, it will go even to the pole."<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly," said I, carried away by the Captain's reasoning; "if the<br>
        surface of the sea is solidified by the ice, the lower depths are free<br>
        by the Providential law which has placed the maximum of density of the<br>
        waters of the ocean one degree higher than freezing-point; and, if I am<br>
        not mistaken, the portion of this iceberg which is above the water is<br>
        as one to four to that which is below."<br>
        <br>
        "Very nearly, sir; for one foot of iceberg above the sea there are<br>
        three below it.  If these ice mountains are not more than 300 feet<br>
        above the surface, they are not more than 900 beneath.  And what are<br>
        900 feet to the Nautilus?"<br>
        <br>
        "Nothing, sir."<br>
        <br>
        "It could even seek at greater depths that uniform temperature of<br>
        sea-water, and there brave with impunity the thirty or forty degrees of<br>
        surface cold."<br>
        <br>
        "Just so, sir--just so," I replied, getting animated.<br>
        <br>
        "The only difficulty," continued Captain Nemo, "is that of remaining<br>
        several days without renewing our provision of air."<br>
        <br>
        "Is that all?  The Nautilus has vast reservoirs; we can fill them, and<br>
        they will supply us with all the oxygen we want."<br>
        <br>
        "Well thought of, M. Aronnax," replied the Captain, smiling.  "But, not<br>
        wishing you to accuse me of rashness, I will first give you all my<br>
        objections."<br>
        <br>
        "Have you any more to make?"<br>
        <br>
        "Only one.  It is possible, if the sea exists at the South Pole, that<br>
        it may be covered; and, consequently, we shall be unable to come to the<br>
        surface."<br>
        <br>
        "Good, sir! but do you forget that the Nautilus is armed with a<br>
        powerful spur, and could we not send it diagonally against these fields<br>
        of ice, which would open at the shocks."<br>
        <a href=../site4/page4_1385.html>external_link0_text</a><br><br>
        <br>
        "Ah! sir, you are full of ideas to-day."<br>
        <br>
        "Besides, Captain," I added, enthusiastically, "why should we not find<br>
        the sea open at the South Pole as well as at the North?  The frozen<br>
        poles of the earth do not coincide, either in the southern or in the<br>
        northern regions; and, until it is proved to the contrary, we may<br>
        suppose either a continent or an ocean free from ice at these two<br>
        points of the globe."<br>
        <br>
        "I think so too, M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo.  "I only wish you<br>
        to observe that, after having made so many objections to my project,<br>
        you are now crushing me with arguments in its favour!"<br>
        <br>
        The preparations for this audacious attempt now began.  The powerful<br>
        pumps of the Nautilus were working air into the reservoirs and storing<br>
        it at high pressure.  About four o'clock, Captain Nemo announced the<br>
        closing of the panels on the platform.  I threw one last look at the<br>
        massive iceberg which we were going to cross.  The weather was clear,<br>
        the atmosphere pure enough, the cold very great, being 12° below<br>
        zero; but, the wind having gone down, this temperature was not so<br>
        unbearable.  About ten men mounted the sides of the Nautilus, armed<br>
        with pickaxes to break the ice around the vessel, which was soon free.<br>
        The operation was quickly performed, for the fresh ice was still very<br>
        thin.  We all went below.  The usual reservoirs were filled with the<br>
        newly-liberated water, and the Nautilus soon descended.  I had taken my<br>
        place with Conseil in the saloon; through the open window we could see<br>
        the lower beds of the Southern Ocean.  The thermometer went up, the<br>
        needle of the compass deviated on the dial.  At about 900 feet, as<br>
        Captain Nemo had foreseen, we were floating beneath the undulating<br>
        bottom of the iceberg.  But the Nautilus went lower still--it went to<br>
        the depth of four hundred fathoms.  The temperature of the water at the<br>
        surface showed twelve degrees, it was now only ten; we had gained two.<br>
        I need not say the temperature of the Nautilus was raised by its<br>
        heating apparatus to a much higher degree; every manoeuvre was<br>
        accomplished with wonderful precision.<br>
        <br>
        "We shall pass it, if you please, sir," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "I believe we shall," I said, in a tone of firm conviction.<br>
        <br>
        In this open sea, the Nautilus had taken its course direct to the pole,<br>
        without leaving the fifty-second meridian.  From 67° 30' to 90<br>
        deg., twenty-two degrees and a half of latitude remained to travel;<br>
        that is, about five hundred leagues.  The Nautilus kept up a mean speed<br>
        of twenty-six miles an hour--the speed of an express train.  If that<br>
        was kept up, in forty hours we should reach the pole.<br>
        <br>
        For a part of the night the novelty of the situation kept us at the<br>
        window.  The sea was lit with the electric lantern; but it was<br>
        deserted; fishes did not sojourn in these imprisoned waters; they only<br>
        found there a passage to take them from the Antarctic Ocean to the open<br>
        polar sea.  Our pace was rapid; we could feel it by the quivering of<br>
        the long steel body.  About two in the morning I took some hours'<br>
        repose, and Conseil did the same.  In crossing the waist I did not meet<br>
        Captain Nemo: I supposed him to be in the pilot's cage.  The next<br>
        morning, the 19th of March, I took my post once more in the saloon.<br>
        The electric log told me that the speed of the Nautilus had been<br>
        slackened.  It was then going towards the surface; but prudently<br>
        emptying its reservoirs very slowly.  My heart beat fast.  Were we<br>
        going to emerge and regain the open polar atmosphere?  No!  A shock<br>
        told me that the Nautilus had struck the bottom of the iceberg, still<br>
        very thick, judging from the deadened sound.  We had in deed "struck,"<br>
        to use a sea expression, but in an inverse sense, and at a thousand<br>
        feet deep.  This would give three thousand feet of ice above us; one<br>
        thousand being above the water-mark. The iceberg was then higher than<br>
        at its borders--not a very reassuring fact.  Several times that day the<br>
        Nautilus tried again, and every time it struck the wall which lay like<br>
        a ceiling above it.  Sometimes it met with but 900 yards, only 200 of<br>
        which rose above the surface.  It was twice the height it was when the<br>
        Nautilus had gone under the waves.  I carefully noted the different<br>
        depths, and thus obtained a submarine profile of the chain as it was<br>
        developed under the water.  That night no change had taken place in our<br>
        situation.  Still ice between four and five hundred yards in depth!  It<br>
        was evidently diminishing, but, still, what a thickness between us and<br>
        the surface of the ocean!  It was then eight.  According to the daily<br>
        custom on board the Nautilus, its air should have been renewed four<br>
        hours ago; but I did not suffer much, although Captain Nemo had not yet<br>
        made any demand upon his reserve of oxygen.  My sleep was painful that<br>
        night; hope and fear besieged me by turns: I rose several times.  The<br>
        groping of the Nautilus continued.  About three in the morning, I<br>
        noticed that the lower surface of the iceberg was only about fifty feet<br>
        deep.  One hundred and fifty feet now separated us from the surface of<br>
        the waters.  The iceberg was by degrees becoming an ice-field, the<br>
        mountain a plain.  My eyes never left the manometer.  We were still<br>
        rising diagonally to the surface, which sparkled under the electric<br>
        rays.  The iceberg was stretching both above and beneath into<br>
        lengthening slopes; mile after mile it was getting thinner.  At length,<br>
        at six in the morning of that memorable day, the 19th of March, the<br>
        door of the saloon opened, and Captain Nemo appeared.<br>
        <br>
        "The sea is open!!" was all he said.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XIV<br>
        <br>
        THE SOUTH POLE<br>
        <br>
        I rushed on to the platform.  Yes! the open sea, with but a few<br>
        scattered pieces of ice and moving icebergs--a long stretch of sea; a<br>
        world of birds in the air, and myriads of fishes under those waters,<br>
        which varied from intense blue to olive green, according to the bottom.<br>
        The thermometer marked 3° C. above zero.  It was comparatively<br>
        spring, shut up as we were behind this iceberg, whose lengthened mass<br>
        was dimly seen on our northern horizon.<br>
        <br>
        "Are we at the pole?"  I asked the Captain, with a beating heart.<br>
        <br>
        "I do not know," he replied.  "At noon I will take our bearings."<br>
        <br>
        "But will the sun show himself through this fog?" said I, looking at<br>
        the leaden sky.<br>
        <br>
        "However little it shows, it will be enough," replied the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        About ten miles south a solitary island rose to a height of one hundred<br>
        and four yards.  We made for it, but carefully, for the sea might be<br>
        strewn with banks.  One hour afterwards we had reached it, two hours<br>
        later we had made the round of it.  It measured four or five miles in<br>
        circumference.  A narrow canal separated it from a considerable stretch<br>
        of land, perhaps a continent, for we could not see its limits.  The<br>
        existence of this land seemed to give some colour to Maury's theory.<br>
        The ingenious American has remarked that, between the South Pole and<br>
        the sixtieth parallel, the sea is covered with floating ice of enormous<br>
        size, which is never met with in the North Atlantic.  From this fact he<br>
        has drawn the conclusion that the Antarctic Circle encloses<br>
        considerable continents, as icebergs cannot form in open sea, but only<br>
        on the coasts.  According to these calculations, the mass of ice<br>
        surrounding the southern pole forms a vast cap, the circumference of<br>
        which must be, at least, 2,500 miles.  But the Nautilus, for fear of<br>
        running aground, had stopped about three cable-lengths from a strand<br>
        over which reared a superb heap of rocks.  The boat was launched; the<br>
        Captain, two of his men, bearing instruments, Conseil, and myself were<br>
        in it.  It was ten in the morning.  I had not seen Ned Land.  Doubtless<br>
        the Canadian did not wish to admit the presence of the South Pole.  A<br>
        few strokes of the oar brought us to the sand, where we ran ashore.<br>
        Conseil was going to jump on to the land, when I held him back.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said I to Captain Nemo, "to you belongs the honour of first<br>
        setting foot on this land."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir," said the Captain, "and if I do not hesitate to tread this<br>
        South Pole, it is because, up to this time, no human being has left a<br>
        trace there."<br>
        <br>
        Saying this, he jumped lightly on to the sand.  His heart beat with<br>
        emotion.  He climbed a rock, sloping to a little promontory, and there,<br>
        with his arms crossed, mute and motionless, and with an eager look, he<br>
        seemed to take possession of these southern regions.  After five<br>
        minutes passed in this ecstasy, he turned to us.<br>
        <br>
        "When you like, sir."<br>
        <br>
        I landed, followed by Conseil, leaving the two men in the boat.  For a<br>
        long way the soil was composed of a reddish sandy stone, something like<br>
        crushed brick, scoriae, streams of lava, and pumice-stones. One could<br>
        not mistake its volcanic origin.  In some parts, slight curls of smoke<br>
        emitted a sulphurous smell, proving that the internal fires had lost<br>
        nothing of their expansive powers, though, having climbed a high<br>
        acclivity, I could see no volcano for a radius of several miles.  We<br>
        know that in those Antarctic countries, James Ross found two craters,<br>
        the Erebus and Terror, in full activity, on the 167th meridian,<br>
        latitude 77° 32'. The vegetation of this desolate continent seemed<br>
        to me much restricted.  Some lichens lay upon the black rocks; some<br>
        microscopic plants, rudimentary diatomas, a kind of cells placed<br>
        between two quartz shells; long purple and scarlet weed, supported on<br>
        little swimming bladders, which the breaking of the waves brought to<br>
        the shore.  These constituted the meagre flora of this region.  The<br>
        shore was strewn with molluscs, little mussels, and limpets.  I also<br>
        saw myriads of northern clios, one-and-a-quarter inches long, of which<br>
        a whale would swallow a whole world at a mouthful; and some perfect<br>
        sea-butterflies, animating the waters on the skirts of the shore.<br>
        <br>
        There appeared on the high bottoms some coral shrubs, of the kind<br>
        which, according to James Ross, live in the Antarctic seas to the depth<br>
        of more than 1,000 yards.  Then there were little kingfishers and<br>
        starfish studding the soil.  But where life abounded most was in the<br>
        air.  There thousands of birds fluttered and flew of all kinds,<br>
        deafening us with their cries; others crowded the rock, looking at us<br>
        as we passed by without fear, and pressing familiarly close by our<br>
        feet.  There were penguins, so agile in the water, heavy and awkward as<br>
        they are on the ground; they were uttering harsh cries, a large<br>
        assembly, sober in gesture, but extravagant in clamour.  Albatrosses<br>
        passed in the air, the expanse of their wings being at least four yards<br>
        and a half, and justly called the vultures of the ocean; some gigantic<br>
        petrels, and some damiers, a kind of small duck, the underpart of whose<br>
        body is black and white; then there were a whole series of petrels,<br>
        some whitish, with brown-bordered wings, others blue, peculiar to the<br>
        Antarctic seas, and so oily, as I told Conseil, that the inhabitants of<br>
        the Ferroe Islands had nothing to do before lighting them but to put a<br>
        wick in.<br>
        <br>
        "A little more," said Conseil, "and they would be perfect lamps!  After<br>
        that, we cannot expect Nature to have previously furnished them with<br>
        wicks!"<br>
        <br>
        About half a mile farther on the soil was riddled with ruffs' nests, a<br>
        sort of laying-ground, out of which many birds were issuing.  Captain<br>
        Nemo had some hundreds hunted.  They uttered a cry like the braying of<br>
        an ass, were about the size of a goose, slate-colour on the body, white<br>
        beneath, with a yellow line round their throats; they allowed<br>
        themselves to be killed with a stone, never trying to escape.  But the<br>
        fog did not lift, and at eleven the sun had not yet shown itself.  Its<br>
        absence made me uneasy.  Without it no observations were possible.<br>
        How, then, could we decide whether we had reached the pole?  When I<br>
        rejoined Captain Nemo, I found him leaning on a piece of rock, silently<br>
        watching the sky.  He seemed impatient and vexed.  But what was to be<br>
        done?  This rash and powerful man could not command the sun as he did<br>
        the sea.  Noon arrived without the orb of day showing itself for an<br>
        instant.  We could not even tell its position behind the curtain of<br>
        fog; and soon the fog turned to snow.<br>
        <br>
        "Till to-morrow," said the Captain, quietly, and we returned to the<br>
        Nautilus amid these atmospheric disturbances.<br>
        <br>
        The tempest of snow continued till the next day.  It was impossible to<br>
        remain on the platform.  From the saloon, where I was taking notes of<br>
        incidents happening during this excursion to the polar continent, I<br>
        could hear the cries of petrels and albatrosses sporting in the midst<br>
        of this violent storm.  The Nautilus did not remain motionless, but<br>
        skirted the coast, advancing ten miles more to the south in the<br>
        half-light left by the sun as it skirted the edge of the horizon.  The<br>
        next day, the 20th of March, the snow had ceased.  The cold was a<br>
        little greater, the thermometer showing 2° below zero.  The fog<br>
        was rising, and I hoped that that day our observations might be taken.<br>
        Captain Nemo not having yet appeared, the boat took Conseil and myself<br>
        to land.  The soil was still of the same volcanic nature; everywhere<br>
        were traces of lava, scoriae, and basalt; but the crater which had<br>
        vomited them I could not see.  Here, as lower down, this continent was<br>
        alive with myriads of birds.  But their rule was now divided with large<br>
        troops of sea-mammals, looking at us with their soft eyes.  There were<br>
        several kinds of seals, some stretched on the earth, some on flakes of<br>
        ice, many going in and out of the sea.  They did not flee at our<br>
        approach, never having had anything to do with man; and I reckoned that<br>
        there were provisions there for hundreds of vessels.<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," said Conseil, "will you tell me the names of these creatures?"<br>
        <br>
        "They are seals and morses."<br>
        <br>
        It was now eight in the morning.  Four hours remained to us before the<br>
        sun could be observed with advantage.  I directed our steps towards a<br>
        vast bay cut in the steep granite shore.  There, I can aver that earth<br>
        and ice were lost to sight by the numbers of sea-mammals covering them,<br>
        and I involuntarily sought for old Proteus, the mythological shepherd<br>
        who watched these immense flocks of Neptune.  There were more seals<br>
        than anything else, forming distinct groups, male and female, the<br>
        father watching over his family, the mother suckling her little ones,<br>
        some already strong enough to go a few steps.  When they wished to<br>
        change their place, they took little jumps, made by the contraction of<br>
        their bodies, and helped awkwardly enough by their imperfect fin,<br>
        which, as with the lamantin, their cousins, forms a perfect forearm.  I<br>
        should say that, in the water, which is their element--the spine of<br>
        these creatures is flexible; with smooth and close skin and webbed<br>
        feet--they swim admirably.  In resting on the earth they take the most<br>
        graceful attitudes.  Thus the ancients, observing their soft and<br>
        expressive looks, which cannot be surpassed by the most beautiful look<br>
        a woman can give, their clear voluptuous eyes, their charming<br>
        positions, and the poetry of their manners, metamorphosed them, the<br>
        male into a triton and the female into a mermaid.  I made Conseil<br>
        notice the considerable development of the lobes of the brain in these<br>
        interesting cetaceans.  No mammal, except man, has such a quantity of<br>
        brain matter; they are also capable of receiving a certain amount of<br>
        education, are easily domesticated, and I think, with other<br>
        naturalists, that if properly taught they would be of great service as<br>
        fishing-dogs.  The greater part of them slept on the rocks or on the<br>
        sand.  Amongst these seals, properly so called, which have no external<br>
        ears (in which they differ from the otter, whose ears are prominent), I<br>
        noticed several varieties of seals about three yards long, with a white<br>
        coat, bulldog heads, armed with teeth in both jaws, four incisors at<br>
        the top and four at the bottom, and two large canine teeth in the shape<br>
        of a fleur-de-lis. Amongst them glided sea-elephants, a kind of seal,<br>
        with short, flexible trunks.  The giants of this species measured<br>
        twenty feet round and ten yards and a half in length; but they did not<br>
        move as we approached.<br>
        <br>
        "These creatures are not dangerous?" asked Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "No; not unless you attack them.  When they have to defend their young<br>
        their rage is terrible, and it is not uncommon for them to break the<br>
        fishing-boats to pieces."<br>
        <br>
        "They are quite right," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "I do not say they are not."<br>
        <br>
        Two miles farther on we were stopped by the promontory which shelters<br>
        the bay from the southerly winds.  Beyond it we heard loud bellowings<br>
        such as a troop of ruminants would produce.<br>
        <br>
        "Good!" said Conseil; "a concert of bulls!"<br>
        <br>
        "No; a concert of morses."<br>
        <br>
        "They are fighting!"<br>
        <br>
        "They are either fighting or playing."<br>
        <br>
        We now began to climb the blackish rocks, amid unforeseen stumbles, and<br>
        over stones which the ice made slippery.  More than once I rolled over<br>
        at the expense of my loins.  Conseil, more prudent or more steady, did<br>
        not stumble, and helped me up, saying:<br>
        <br>
        "If, sir, you would have the kindness to take wider steps, you would<br>
        preserve your equilibrium better."<br>
        <br>
        Arrived at the upper ridge of the promontory, I saw a vast white plain<br>
        covered with morses.  They were playing amongst themselves, and what we<br>
        heard were bellowings of pleasure, not of anger.<br>
        <br>
        <a href=../site0/page0_6556.html>internal_link1_text</a><br><br>
        As I passed these curious animals I could examine them leisurely, for<br>
        they did not move.  Their skins were thick and rugged, of a yellowish<br>
        tint, approaching to red; their hair was short and scant.  Some of them<br>
        were four yards and a quarter long.  Quieter and less timid than their<br>
        cousins of the north, they did not, like them, place sentinels round<br>
        the outskirts of their encampment.  After examining this city of<br>
        morses, I began to think of returning.  It was eleven o'clock, and, if<br>
        Captain Nemo found the conditions favourable for observations, I wished<br>
        to be present at the operation.  We followed a narrow pathway running<br>
        along the summit of the steep shore.  At half-past eleven we had<br>
        reached the place where we landed.  The boat had run aground, bringing<br>
        the Captain.  I saw him standing on a block of basalt, his instruments<br>
        near him, his eyes fixed on the northern horizon, near which the sun<br>
        was then describing a lengthened curve.  I took my place beside him,<br>
        and waited without speaking.  Noon arrived, and, as before, the sun did<br>
        not appear.  It was a fatality.  Observations were still wanting.  If<br>
        not accomplished to-morrow, we must give up all idea of taking any.  We<br>
        were indeed exactly at the 20th of March.  To-morrow, the 21st, would<br>
        be the equinox; the sun would disappear behind the horizon for six<br>
        months, and with its disappearance the long polar night would begin.<br>
        Since the September equinox it had emerged from the northern horizon,<br>
        rising by lengthened spirals up to the 21st of December.  At this<br>
        period, the summer solstice of the northern regions, it had begun to<br>
        descend; and to-morrow was to shed its last rays upon them.  I<br>
        communicated my fears and observations to Captain Nemo.<br>
        <br>
        "You are right, M. Aronnax," said he; "if to-morrow I cannot take the<br>
        altitude of the sun, I shall not be able to do it for six months.  But<br>
        precisely because chance has led me into these seas on the 21st of<br>
        March, my bearings will be easy to take, if at twelve we can see the<br>
        sun."<br>
        <br>
        "Why, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "Because then the orb of day described such lengthened curves that it<br>
        is difficult to measure exactly its height above the horizon, and grave<br>
        errors may be made with instruments."<br>
        <br>
        "What will you do then?"<br>
        <br>
        "I shall only use my chronometer," replied Captain Nemo.  "If<br>
        to-morrow, the 21st of March, the disc of the sun, allowing for<br>
        refraction, is exactly cut by the northern horizon, it will show that I<br>
        am at the South Pole."<br>
        <br>
        "Just so," said I. "But this statement is not mathematically correct,<br>
        because the equinox does not necessarily begin at noon."<br>
        <br>
        "Very likely, sir; but the error will not be a hundred yards and we do<br>
        not want more.  Till to-morrow, then!"<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo returned on board.  Conseil and I remained to survey the<br>
        shore, observing and studying until five o'clock. Then I went to bed,<br>
        not, however, without invoking, like the Indian, the favour of the<br>
        radiant orb.  The next day, the 21st of March, at five in the morning,<br>
        I mounted the platform.  I found Captain Nemo there.<br>
        <br>
        "The weather is lightening a little," said he.  "I have some hope.<br>
        After breakfast we will go on shore and choose a post for observation."<br>
        <br>
        That point settled, I sought Ned Land.  I wanted to take him with me.<br>
        But the obstinate Canadian refused, and I saw that his taciturnity and<br>
        his bad humour grew day by day.  After all, I was not sorry for his<br>
        obstinacy under the circumstances.  Indeed, there were too many seals<br>
        on shore, and we ought not to lay such temptation in this unreflecting<br>
        fisherman's way.  Breakfast over, we went on shore.  The Nautilus had<br>
        gone some miles further up in the night.  It was a whole league from<br>
        the coast, above which reared a sharp peak about five hundred yards<br>
        high.  The boat took with me Captain Nemo, two men of the crew, and the<br>
        instruments, which consisted of a chronometer, a telescope, and a<br>
        barometer.  While crossing, I saw numerous whales belonging to the<br>
        three kinds peculiar to the southern seas; the whale, or the English<br>
        "right whale," which has no dorsal fin; the "humpback," with reeved<br>
        chest and large, whitish fins, which, in spite of its name, do not form<br>
        wings; and the fin-back, of a yellowish brown, the liveliest of all the<br>
        cetacea.  This powerful creature is heard a long way off when he throws<br>
        to a great height columns of air and vapour, which look like whirlwinds<br>
        of smoke.  These different mammals were disporting themselves in troops<br>
        in the quiet waters; and I could see that this basin of the Antarctic<br>
        Pole serves as a place of refuge to the cetacea too closely tracked by<br>
        the hunters.  I also noticed large medusae floating between the reeds.<br>
        <br>
        At nine we landed; the sky was brightening, the clouds were flying to<br>
        the south, and the fog seemed to be leaving the cold surface of the<br>
        waters.  Captain Nemo went towards the peak, which he doubtless meant<br>
        to be his observatory.  It was a painful ascent over the sharp lava and<br>
        the pumice-stones, in an atmosphere often impregnated with a sulphurous<br>
        smell from the smoking cracks.  For a man unaccustomed to walk on land,<br>
        the Captain climbed the steep slopes with an agility I never saw<br>
        equalled and which a hunter would have envied.  We were two hours<br>
        getting to the summit of this peak, which was half porphyry and half<br>
        basalt.  From thence we looked upon a vast sea which, towards the<br>
        north, distinctly traced its boundary line upon the sky.  At our feet<br>
        lay fields of dazzling whiteness.  Over our heads a pale azure, free<br>
        from fog.  To the north the disc of the sun seemed like a ball of fire,<br>
        already horned by the cutting of the horizon.  From the bosom of the<br>
        water rose sheaves of liquid jets by hundreds.  In the distance lay the<br>
        Nautilus like a cetacean asleep on the water.  Behind us, to the south<br>
        and east, an immense country and a chaotic heap of rocks and ice, the<br>
        limits of which were not visible.  On arriving at the summit Captain<br>
        Nemo carefully took the mean height of the barometer, for he would have<br>
        to consider that in taking his observations.  At a quarter to twelve<br>
        the sun, then seen only by refraction, looked like a golden disc<br>
        shedding its last rays upon this deserted continent and seas which<br>
        never man had yet ploughed.  Captain Nemo, furnished with a lenticular<br>
        glass which, by means of a mirror, corrected the refraction, watched<br>
        the orb sinking below the horizon by degrees, following a lengthened<br>
        diagonal.  I held the chronometer.  My heart beat fast.  If the<br>
        disappearance of the half-disc of the sun coincided with twelve o'clock<br>
        on the chronometer, we were at the pole itself.<br>
        <br>
        "Twelve!"  I exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        "The South Pole!" replied Captain Nemo, in a grave voice, handing me<br>
        the glass, which showed the orb cut in exactly equal parts by the<br>
        horizon.<br>
        <br>
        I looked at the last rays crowning the peak, and the shadows mounting<br>
        by degrees up its slopes.  At that moment Captain Nemo, resting with<br>
        his hand on my shoulder, said:<br>
        <br>
        "I, Captain Nemo, on this 21st day of March, 1868, have reached the<br>
        South Pole on the ninetieth degree; and I take possession of this part<br>
        of the globe, equal to one-sixth of the known continents."<br>
        <br>
        "In whose name, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "In my own, sir!"<br>
        <br>
        Saying which, Captain Nemo unfurled a black banner, bearing an "N" in<br>
        gold quartered on its bunting.  Then, turning towards the orb of day,<br>
        whose last rays lapped the horizon of the sea, he exclaimed:<br>
        <br>
        "Adieu, sun!  Disappear, thou radiant orb! rest beneath this open sea,<br>
        and let a night of six months spread its shadows over my new domains!"<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XV<br>
        <br>
        ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT?<br>
        <br>
        The next day, the 22nd of March, at six in the morning, preparations<br>
        for departure were begun.  The last gleams of twilight were melting<br>
        into night.  The cold was great, the constellations shone with<br>
        wonderful intensity.  In the zenith glittered that wondrous Southern<br>
        Cross--the polar bear of Antarctic regions.  The thermometer showed 120<br>
        below zero, and when the wind freshened it was most biting.  Flakes of<br>
        ice increased on the open water.  The sea seemed everywhere alike.<br>
        Numerous blackish patches spread on the surface, showing the formation<br>
        of fresh ice.  Evidently the southern basin, frozen during the six<br>
        winter months, was absolutely inaccessible.  What became of the whales<br>
        in that time?  Doubtless they went beneath the icebergs, seeking more<br>
        practicable seas.  As to the seals and morses, accustomed to live in a<br>
        hard climate, they remained on these icy shores.  These creatures have<br>
        the instinct to break holes in the ice-field and to keep them open.  To<br>
        these holes they come for breath; when the birds, driven away by the<br>
        cold, have emigrated to the north, these sea mammals remain sole<br>
        masters of the polar continent.  But the reservoirs were filling with<br>
        water, and the Nautilus was slowly descending.  At 1,000 feet deep it<br>
        stopped; its screw beat the waves, and it advanced straight towards the<br>
        north at a speed of fifteen miles an hour.  Towards night it was<br>
        already floating under the immense body of the iceberg.  At three in<br>
        the morning I was awakened by a violent shock.  I sat up in my bed and<br>
        listened in the darkness, when I was thrown into the middle of the<br>
        room.  The Nautilus, after having struck, had rebounded violently.  I<br>
        groped along the partition, and by the staircase to the saloon, which<br>
        was lit by the luminous ceiling.  The furniture was upset.  Fortunately<br>
        the windows were firmly set, and had held fast.  The pictures on the<br>
        starboard side, from being no longer vertical, were clinging to the<br>
        paper, whilst those of the port side were hanging at least a foot from<br>
        the wall.  The Nautilus was lying on its starboard side perfectly<br>
        motionless.  I heard footsteps, and a confusion of voices; but Captain<br>
        Nemo did not appear.  As I was leaving the saloon, Ned Land and Conseil<br>
        entered.<br>
        <br>
        "What is the matter?" said I, at once.<br>
        <br>
        "I came to ask you, sir," replied Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Confound it!" exclaimed the Canadian, "I know well enough!  The<br>
        Nautilus has struck; and, judging by the way she lies, I do not think<br>
        she will right herself as she did the first time in Torres Straits."<br>
        <br>
        "But," I asked, "has she at least come to the surface of the sea?"<br>
        <br>
        "We do not know," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "It is easy to decide," I answered.  I consulted the manometer.  To my<br>
        great surprise, it showed a depth of more than 180 fathoms.  "What does<br>
        that mean?"  I exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        "We must ask Captain Nemo," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "But where shall we find him?" said Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        "Follow me," said I, to my companions.<br>
        <br>
        We left the saloon.  There was no one in the library.  At the centre<br>
        staircase, by the berths of the ship's crew, there was no one.  I<br>
        thought that Captain Nemo must be in the pilot's cage.  It was best to<br>
        wait.  We all returned to the saloon.  For twenty minutes we remained<br>
        thus, trying to hear the slightest noise which might be made on board<br>
        the Nautilus, when Captain Nemo entered.  He seemed not to see us; his<br>
        face, generally so impassive, showed signs of uneasiness.  He watched<br>
        the compass silently, then the manometer; and, going to the<br>
        planisphere, placed his finger on a spot representing the southern<br>
        seas.  I would not interrupt him; but, some minutes later, when he<br>
        turned towards me, I said, using one of his own expressions in the<br>
        Torres Straits:<br>
        <br>
        "An incident, Captain?"<br>
        <br>
        "No, sir; an accident this time."<br>
        <br>
        "Serious?"<br>
        <br>
        "Perhaps."<br>
        <br>
        "Is the danger immediate?"<br>
        <br>
        "No."<br>
        <br>
        "The Nautilus has stranded?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes."<br>
        <br>
        "And this has happened--how?"<br>
        <br>
        "From a caprice of nature, not from the ignorance of man.  Not a<br>
        mistake has been made in the working.  But we cannot prevent<br>
        equilibrium from producing its effects.  We may brave human laws, but<br>
        we cannot resist natural ones."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo had chosen a strange moment for uttering this<br>
        philosophical reflection.  On the whole, his answer helped me little.<br>
        <br>
        "May I ask, sir, the cause of this accident?"<br>
        <br>
        "An enormous block of ice, a whole mountain, has turned over," he<br>
        replied.  "When icebergs are undermined at their base by warmer water<br>
        or reiterated shocks their centre of gravity rises, and the whole thing<br>
        turns over.  This is what has happened; one of these blocks, as it<br>
        fell, struck the Nautilus, then, gliding under its hull, raised it with<br>
        irresistible force, bringing it into beds which are not so thick, where<br>
        it is lying on its side."<br>
        <br>
        "But can we not get the Nautilus off by emptying its reservoirs, that<br>
        it might regain its equilibrium?"<br>
        <br>
        "That, sir, is being done at this moment.  You can hear the pump<br>
        working.  Look at the needle of the manometer; it shows that the<br>
        Nautilus is rising, but the block of ice is floating with it; and,<br>
        until some obstacle stops its ascending motion, our position cannot be<br>
        altered."<br>
        <br>
        Indeed, the Nautilus still held the same position to starboard;<br>
        doubtless it would right itself when the block stopped.  But at this<br>
        moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two<br>
        glassy surfaces?  I reflected on all the consequences of our position.<br>
        Captain Nemo never took his eyes off the manometer.  Since the fall of<br>
        the iceberg, the Nautilus had risen about a hundred and fifty feet, but<br>
        it still made the same angle with the perpendicular.  Suddenly a slight<br>
        movement was felt in the hold.  Evidently it was righting a little.<br>
        Things hanging in the saloon were sensibly returning to their normal<br>
        position.  The partitions were nearing the upright.  No one spoke.<br>
        With beating hearts we watched and felt the straightening.  The boards<br>
        became horizontal under our feet.  Ten minutes passed.<br>
        <br>
        "At last we have righted!"  I exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," said Captain Nemo, going to the door of the saloon.<br>
        <br>
        "But are we floating?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly," he replied; "since the reservoirs are not empty; and, when<br>
        empty, the Nautilus must rise to the surface of the sea."<br>
        <br>
        We were in open sea; but at a distance of about ten yards, on either<br>
        side of the Nautilus, rose a dazzling wall of ice.  Above and beneath<br>
        the same wall.  Above, because the lower surface of the iceberg<br>
        stretched over us like an immense ceiling.  Beneath, because the<br>
        overturned block, having slid by degrees, had found a resting-place on<br>
        the lateral walls, which kept it in that position.  The Nautilus was<br>
        really imprisoned in a perfect tunnel of ice more than twenty yards in<br>
        breadth, filled with quiet water.  It was easy to get out of it by<br>
        going either forward or backward, and then make a free passage under<br>
        the iceberg, some hundreds of yards deeper.  The luminous ceiling had<br>
        been extinguished, but the saloon was still resplendent with intense<br>
        light.  It was the powerful reflection from the glass partition sent<br>
        violently back to the sheets of the lantern.  I cannot describe the<br>
        effect of the voltaic rays upon the great blocks so capriciously cut;<br>
        upon every angle, every ridge, every facet was thrown a different<br>
        light, according to the nature of the veins running through the ice; a<br>
        dazzling mine of gems, particularly of sapphires, their blue rays<br>
        crossing with the green of the emerald.  Here and there were opal<br>
        shades of wonderful softness, running through bright spots like<br>
        diamonds of fire, the brilliancy of which the eye could not bear.  The<br>
        power of the lantern seemed increased a hundredfold, like a lamp<br>
        through the lenticular plates of a first-class lighthouse.<br>
        <br>
        "How beautiful! how beautiful!" cried Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," I said, "it is a wonderful sight.  Is it not, Ned?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, confound it!  Yes," answered Ned Land, "it is superb!  I am mad<br>
        at being obliged to admit it.  No one has ever seen anything like it;<br>
        but the sight may cost us dear.  And, if I must say all, I think we are<br>
        seeing here things which God never intended man to see."<br>
        <br>
        Ned was right, it was too beautiful.  Suddenly a cry from Conseil made<br>
        <a href=../site1/page1_2190.html>external_link2_text</a><br><br>
        me turn.<br>
        <br>
        "What is it?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Shut your eyes, sir!  Do not look, sir!"  Saying which, Conseil<br>
        clapped his hands over his eyes.<br>
        <br>
        "But what is the matter, my boy?"<br>
        <br>
        "I am dazzled, blinded."<br>
        <br>
        My eyes turned involuntarily towards the glass, but I could not stand<br>
        the fire which seemed to devour them.  I understood what had happened.<br>
        The Nautilus had put on full speed.  All the quiet lustre of the<br>
        ice-walls was at once changed into flashes of lightning.  The fire from<br>
        these myriads of diamonds was blinding.  It required some time to calm<br>
        our troubled looks.  At last the hands were taken down.<br>
        <br>
        "Faith, I should never have believed it," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        It was then five in the morning; and at that moment a shock was felt at<br>
        the bows of the Nautilus.  I knew that its spur had struck a block of<br>
        ice.  It must have been a false manoeuvre, for this submarine tunnel,<br>
        obstructed by blocks, was not very easy navigation.  I thought that<br>
        Captain Nemo, by changing his course, would either turn these obstacles<br>
        or else follow the windings of the tunnel.  In any case, the road<br>
        before us could not be entirely blocked.  But, contrary to my<br>
        expectations, the Nautilus took a decided retrograde motion.<br>
        <br>
        "We are going backwards?" said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," I replied.  "This end of the tunnel can have no egress."<br>
        <br>
        "And then?"<br>
        <br>
        "Then," said I, "the working is easy.  We must go back again, and go<br>
        out at the southern opening.  That is all."<br>
        <br>
        In speaking thus, I wished to appear more confident than I really was.<br>
        But the retrograde motion of the Nautilus was increasing; and,<br>
        reversing the screw, it carried us at great speed.<br>
        <br>
        "It will be a hindrance," said Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "What does it matter, some hours more or less, provided we get out at<br>
        last?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," repeated Ned Land, "provided we do get out at last!"<br>
        <br>
        For a short time I walked from the saloon to the library.  My<br>
        companions were silent.  I soon threw myself on an ottoman, and took a<br>
        book, which my eyes overran mechanically.  A quarter of an hour after,<br>
        Conseil, approaching me, said, "Is what you are reading very<br>
        interesting, sir?"<br>
        <br>
        "Very interesting!"  I replied.<br>
        <br>
        "I should think so, sir.  It is your own book you are reading."<br>
        <br>
        "My book?"<br>
        <br>
        And indeed I was holding in my hand the work on the Great Submarine<br>
        Depths.  I did not even dream of it.  I closed the book and returned to<br>
        my walk.  Ned and Conseil rose to go.<br>
        <br>
        "Stay here, my friends," said I, detaining them.  "Let us remain<br>
        together until we are out of this block."<br>
        <br>
        "As you please, sir," Conseil replied.<br>
        <br>
        Some hours passed.  I often looked at the instruments hanging from the<br>
        partition.  The manometer showed that the Nautilus kept at a constant<br>
        depth of more than three hundred yards; the compass still pointed to<br>
        south; the log indicated a speed of twenty miles an hour, which, in<br>
        such a cramped space, was very great.  But Captain Nemo knew that he<br>
        could not hasten too much, and that minutes were worth ages to us.  At<br>
        twenty-five minutes past eight a second shock took place, this time<br>
        from behind.  I turned pale.  My companions were close by my side.  I<br>
        seized Conseil's hand.  Our looks expressed our feelings better than<br>
        words.  At this moment the Captain entered the saloon.  I went up to<br>
        him.<br>
        <br>
        "Our course is barred southward?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir.  The iceberg has shifted and closed every outlet."<br>
        <br>
        "We are blocked up then?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes."<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XVI<br>
        <br>
        WANT OF AIR<br>
        <br>
        Thus around the Nautilus, above and below, was an impenetrable wall of<br>
        ice.  We were prisoners to the iceberg.  I watched the Captain.  His<br>
        countenance had resumed its habitual imperturbability.<br>
        <br>
        "Gentlemen," he said calmly, "there are two ways of dying in the<br>
        circumstances in which we are placed."  (This puzzling person had the<br>
        air of a mathematical professor lecturing to his pupils.) "The first is<br>
        to be crushed; the second is to die of suffocation.  I do not speak of<br>
        the possibility of dying of hunger, for the supply of provisions in the<br>
        Nautilus will certainly last longer than we shall.  Let us, then,<br>
        calculate our chances."<br>
        <br>
        "As to suffocation, Captain," I replied, "that is not to be feared,<br>
        because our reservoirs are full."<br>
        <br>
        "Just so; but they will only yield two days' supply of air.  Now, for<br>
        thirty-six hours we have been hidden under the water, and already the<br>
        heavy atmosphere of the Nautilus requires renewal.  In forty-eight<br>
        hours our reserve will be exhausted."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, Captain, can we be delivered before forty-eight hours?"<br>
        <br>
        "We will attempt it, at least, by piercing the wall that surrounds us."<br>
        <br>
        "On which side?"<br>
        <br>
        "Sound will tell us.  I am going to run the Nautilus aground on the<br>
        lower bank, and my men will attack the iceberg on the side that is<br>
        least thick."<br>
        <br>
        Captain Nemo went out.  Soon I discovered by a hissing noise that the<br>
        water was entering the reservoirs.  The Nautilus sank slowly, and<br>
        rested on the ice at a depth of 350 yards, the depth at which the lower<br>
        bank was immersed.<br>
        <br>
        "My friends," I said, "our situation is serious, but I rely on your<br>
        courage and energy."<br>
        <br>
        "Sir," replied the Canadian, "I am ready to do anything for the general<br>
        safety."<br>
        <br>
        "Good!  Ned," and I held out my hand to the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "I will add," he continued, "that, being as handy with the pickaxe as<br>
        with the harpoon, if I can be useful to the Captain, he can command my<br>
        services."<br>
        <br>
        "He will not refuse your help.  Come, Ned!"<br>
        <br>
        I led him to the room where the crew of the Nautilus were putting on<br>
        their cork-jackets. I told the Captain of Ned's proposal, which he<br>
        accepted.  The Canadian put on his sea-costume, and was ready as soon<br>
        as his companions.  When Ned was dressed, I re-entered the<br>
        drawing-room, where the panes of glass were open, and, posted near<br>
        Conseil, I examined the ambient beds that supported the Nautilus.  Some<br>
        instants after, we saw a dozen of the crew set foot on the bank of ice,<br>
        and among them Ned Land, easily known by his stature.  Captain Nemo was<br>
        with them.  Before proceeding to dig the walls, he took the soundings,<br>
        to be sure of working in the right direction.  Long sounding lines were<br>
        sunk in the side walls, but after fifteen yards they were again stopped<br>
        by the thick wall.  It was useless to attack it on the ceiling-like<br>
        surface, since the iceberg itself measured more than 400 yards in<br>
        height.  Captain Nemo then sounded the lower surface.  There ten yards<br>
        of wall separated us from the water, so great was the thickness of the<br>
        ice-field. It was necessary, therefore, to cut from it a piece equal in<br>
        extent to the waterline of the Nautilus.  There were about 6,000 cubic<br>
        yards to detach, so as to dig a hole by which we could descend to the<br>
        ice-field. The work had begun immediately and carried on with<br>
        indefatigable energy.  Instead of digging round the Nautilus which<br>
        would have involved greater difficulty, Captain Nemo had an immense<br>
        trench made at eight yards from the port-quarter. Then the men set to<br>
        work simultaneously with their screws on several points of its<br>
        circumference.  Presently the pickaxe attacked this compact matter<br>
        vigorously, and large blocks were detached from the mass.  By a curious<br>
        effect of specific gravity, these blocks, lighter than water, fled, so<br>
        to speak, to the vault of the tunnel, that increased in thickness at<br>
        the top in proportion as it diminished at the base.  But that mattered<br>
        little, so long as the lower part grew thinner.  After two hours' hard<br>
        work, Ned Land came in exhausted.  He and his comrades were replaced by<br>
        new workers, whom Conseil and I joined.  The second lieutenant of the<br>
        Nautilus superintended us.  The water seemed singularly cold, but I<br>
        soon got warm handling the pickaxe.  My movements were free enough,<br>
        although they were made under a pressure of thirty atmospheres.  When I<br>
        re-entered, after working two hours, to take some food and rest, I<br>
        found a perceptible difference between the pure fluid with which the<br>
        Rouquayrol engine supplied me and the atmosphere of the Nautilus,<br>
        already charged with carbonic acid.  The air had not been renewed for<br>
        forty-eight hours, and its vivifying qualities were considerably<br>
        enfeebled.  However, after a lapse of twelve hours, we had only raised<br>
        a block of ice one yard thick, on the marked surface, which was about<br>
        600 cubic yards!  Reckoning that it took twelve hours to accomplish<br>
        this much it would take five nights and four days to bring this<br>
        enterprise to a satisfactory conclusion.  Five nights and four days!<br>
        And we have only air enough for two days in the reservoirs!  "Without<br>
        taking into account," said Ned, "that, even if we get out of this<br>
        infernal prison, we shall also be imprisoned under the iceberg, shut<br>
        out from all possible communication with the atmosphere." True enough!<br>
        Who could then foresee the minimum of time necessary for our<br>
        deliverance?  We might be suffocated before the Nautilus could regain<br>
        the surface of the waves?  Was it destined to perish in this ice-tomb,<br>
        with all those it enclosed?  The situation was terrible.  But everyone<br>
        had looked the danger in the face, and each was determined to do his<br>
        duty to the last.<br>
        <br>
        As I expected, during the night a new block a yard square was carried<br>
        away, and still further sank the immense hollow.  But in the morning<br>
        when, dressed in my cork-jacket, I traversed the slushy mass at a<br>
        temperature of six or seven degrees below zero, I remarked that the<br>
        side walls were gradually closing in.  The beds of water farthest from<br>
        the trench, that were not warmed by the men's work, showed a tendency<br>
        to solidification.  In presence of this new and imminent danger, what<br>
        would become of our chances of safety, and how hinder the<br>
        solidification of this liquid medium, that would burst the partitions<br>
        of the Nautilus like glass?<br>
        <br>
        I did not tell my companions of this new danger.  What was the good of<br>
        damping the energy they displayed in the painful work of escape?  But<br>
        when I went on board again, I told Captain Nemo of this grave<br>
        complication.<br>
        <br>
        "I know it," he said, in that calm tone which could counteract the most<br>
        terrible apprehensions.  "It is one danger more; but I see no way of<br>
        escaping it; the only chance of safety is to go quicker than<br>
        solidification.  We must be beforehand with it, that is all."<br>
        <br>
        On this day for several hours I used my pickaxe vigorously.  The work<br>
        kept me up.  Besides, to work was to quit the Nautilus, and breathe<br>
        directly the pure air drawn from the reservoirs, and supplied by our<br>
        apparatus, and to quit the impoverished and vitiated atmosphere.<br>
        Towards evening the trench was dug one yard deeper.  When I returned on<br>
        board, I was nearly suffocated by the carbonic acid with which the air<br>
        was filled--ah! if we had only the chemical means to drive away this<br>
        deleterious gas.  We had plenty of oxygen; all this water contained a<br>
        considerable quantity, and by dissolving it with our powerful piles, it<br>
        would restore the vivifying fluid.  I had thought well over it; but of<br>
        what good was that, since the carbonic acid produced by our respiration<br>
        had invaded every part of the vessel?  To absorb it, it was necessary<br>
        to fill some jars with caustic potash, and to shake them incessantly.<br>
        Now this substance was wanting on board, and nothing could replace it.<br>
        On that evening, Captain Nemo ought to open the taps of his reservoirs,<br>
        and let some pure air into the interior of the Nautilus; without this<br>
        precaution we could not get rid of the sense of suffocation.  The next<br>
        day, March 26th, I resumed my miner's work in beginning the fifth yard.<br>
        The side walls and the lower surface of the iceberg thickened visibly.<br>
        It was evident that they would meet before the Nautilus was able to<br>
        disengage itself.  Despair seized me for an instant; my pickaxe nearly<br>
        fell from my hands.  What was the good of digging if I must be<br>
        suffocated, crushed by the water that was turning into stone?--a<br>
        punishment that the ferocity of the savages even would not have<br>
        invented!  Just then Captain Nemo passed near me.  I touched his hand<br>
        and showed him the walls of our prison.  The wall to port had advanced<br>
        to at least four yards from the hull of the Nautilus.  The Captain<br>
        understood me, and signed me to follow him.  We went on board.  I took<br>
        off my cork-jacket and accompanied him into the drawing-room.<br>
        <br>
        "M. Aronnax, we must attempt some desperate means, or we shall be<br>
        sealed up in this solidified water as in cement."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes; but what is to be done?"<br>
        <br>
        "Ah! if my Nautilus were strong enough to bear this pressure without<br>
        being crushed!"<br>
        <br>
        "Well?"  I asked, not catching the Captain's idea.<br>
        <br>
        "Do you not understand," he replied, "that this congelation of water<br>
        will help us?  Do you not see that by its solidification, it would<br>
        burst through this field of ice that imprisons us, as, when it freezes,<br>
        it bursts the hardest stones?  Do you not perceive that it would be an<br>
        agent of safety instead of destruction?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Captain, perhaps.  But, whatever resistance to crushing the<br>
        Nautilus possesses, it could not support this terrible pressure, and<br>
        would be flattened like an iron plate."<br>
        <br>
        "I know it, sir.  Therefore we must not reckon on the aid of nature,<br>
        but on our own exertions.  We must stop this solidification.  Not only<br>
        will the side walls be pressed together; but there is not ten feet of<br>
        water before or behind the Nautilus.  The congelation gains on us on<br>
        all sides."<br>
        <br>
        "How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on<br>
        board?"<br>
        <br>
        The Captain looked in my face.  "After to-morrow they will be empty!"<br>
        <br>
        A cold sweat came over me.  However, ought I to have been astonished at<br>
        the answer?  On March 22, the Nautilus was in the open polar seas.  We<br>
        were at 26°. For five days we had lived on the reserve on board.<br>
        And what was left of the respirable air must be kept for the workers.<br>
        Even now, as I write, my recollection is still so vivid that an<br>
        involuntary terror seizes me and my lungs seem to be without air.<br>
        Meanwhile, Captain Nemo reflected silently, and evidently an idea had<br>
        struck him; but he seemed to reject it.  At last, these words escaped<br>
        his lips:<br>
        <br>
        "Boiling water!" he muttered.<br>
        <br>
        "Boiling water?"  I cried.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir.  We are enclosed in a space that is relatively confined.<br>
        Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps,<br>
        raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?"<br>
        <br>
        "Let us try it," I said resolutely.<br>
        <br>
        "Let us try it, Professor."<br>
        <br>
        The thermometer then stood at 7° outside.  Captain Nemo took me to<br>
        the galleys, where the vast distillatory machines stood that furnished<br>
        the drinkable water by evaporation.  They filled these with water, and<br>
        all the electric heat from the piles was thrown through the worms<br>
        bathed in the liquid.  In a few minutes this water reached 100°. It<br>
        was directed towards the pumps, while fresh water replaced it in<br>
        proportion.  The heat developed by the troughs was such that cold<br>
        <a href=../site1/page1_9712.html>external_link3_text</a><br><br>
        water, drawn up from the sea after only having gone through the<br>
        machines, came boiling into the body of the pump.  The injection was<br>
        begun, and three hours after the thermometer marked 6° below zero<br>
        outside.  One degree was gained.  Two hours later the thermometer only<br>
        marked 4°.<br>
        <br>
        "We shall succeed," I said to the Captain, after having anxiously<br>
        watched the result of the operation.<br>
        <br>
        "I think," he answered, "that we shall not be crushed.  We have no more<br>
        suffocation to fear."<br>
        <br>
        During the night the temperature of the water rose to 1° below<br>
        zero.  The injections could not carry it to a higher point.  But, as<br>
        the congelation of the sea-water produces at least 2°, I was at<br>
        least reassured against the dangers of solidification.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, March 27th, six yards of ice had been cleared, twelve<br>
        feet only remaining to be cleared away.  There was yet forty-eight<br>
        hours' work.  The air could not be renewed in the interior of the<br>
        Nautilus.  And this day would make it worse.  An intolerable weight<br>
        oppressed me.  Towards three o'clock in the evening this feeling rose<br>
        to a violent degree.  Yawns dislocated my jaws.  My lungs panted as<br>
        they inhaled this burning fluid, which became rarefied more and more.<br>
        A moral torpor took hold of me.  I was powerless, almost unconscious.<br>
        My brave Conseil, though exhibiting the same symptoms and suffering in<br>
        the same manner, never left me.  He took my hand and encouraged me, and<br>
        I heard him murmur, "Oh! if I could only not breathe, so as to leave<br>
        more air for my master!"<br>
        <br>
        Tears came into my eyes on hearing him speak thus.  If our situation to<br>
        all was intolerable in the interior, with what haste and gladness would<br>
        we put on our cork-jackets to work in our turn!  Pickaxes sounded on<br>
        the frozen ice-beds. Our arms ached, the skin was torn off our hands.<br>
        But what were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter?  Vital air<br>
        came to the lungs!  We breathed! we breathed!<br>
        <br>
        All this time no one prolonged his voluntary task beyond the prescribed<br>
        time.  His task accomplished, each one handed in turn to his panting<br>
        companions the apparatus that supplied him with life.  Captain Nemo set<br>
        the example, and submitted first to this severe discipline.  When the<br>
        time came, he gave up his apparatus to another and returned to the<br>
        vitiated air on board, calm, unflinching, unmurmuring.<br>
        <br>
        On that day the ordinary work was accomplished with unusual vigour.<br>
        Only two yards remained to be raised from the surface.  Two yards only<br>
        separated us from the open sea.  But the reservoirs were nearly emptied<br>
        of air.  The little that remained ought to be kept for the workers; not<br>
        a particle for the Nautilus.  When I went back on board, I was half<br>
        suffocated.  What a night!  I know not how to describe it.  The next<br>
        day my breathing was oppressed.  Dizziness accompanied the pain in my<br>
        head and made me like a drunken man.  My companions showed the same<br>
        symptoms.  Some of the crew had rattling in the throat.<br>
        <br>
        On that day, the sixth of our imprisonment, Captain Nemo, finding the<br>
        pickaxes work too slowly, resolved to crush the ice-bed that still<br>
        separated us from the liquid sheet.  This man's coolness and energy<br>
        never forsook him.  He subdued his physical pains by moral force.<br>
        <br>
        By his orders the vessel was lightened, that is to say, raised from the<br>
        ice-bed by a change of specific gravity.  When it floated they towed it<br>
        so as to bring it above the immense trench made on the level of the<br>
        water-line. Then, filling his reservoirs of water, he descended and<br>
        shut himself up in the hole.<br>
        <br>
        Just then all the crew came on board, and the double door of<br>
        communication was shut.  The Nautilus then rested on the bed of ice,<br>
        which was not one yard thick, and which the sounding leads had<br>
        perforated in a thousand places.  The taps of the reservoirs were then<br>
        opened, and a hundred cubic yards of water was let in, increasing the<br>
        weight of the Nautilus to 1,800 tons.  We waited, we listened,<br>
        forgetting our sufferings in hope.  Our safety depended on this last<br>
        chance.  Notwithstanding the buzzing in my head, I soon heard the<br>
        humming sound under the hull of the Nautilus.  The ice cracked with a<br>
        singular noise, like tearing paper, and the Nautilus sank.<br>
        <br>
        "We are off!" murmured Conseil in my ear.<br>
        <br>
        I could not answer him.  I seized his hand, and pressed it<br>
        convulsively.  All at once, carried away by its frightful overcharge,<br>
        the Nautilus sank like a bullet under the waters, that is to say, it<br>
        fell as if it was in a vacuum.  Then all the electric force was put on<br>
        the pumps, that soon began to let the water out of the reservoirs.<br>
        After some minutes, our fall was stopped.  Soon, too, the manometer<br>
        indicated an ascending movement.  The screw, going at full speed, made<br>
        the iron hull tremble to its very bolts and drew us towards the north.<br>
        But if this floating under the iceberg is to last another day before we<br>
        reach the open sea, I shall be dead first.<br>
        <br>
        Half stretched upon a divan in the library, I was suffocating.  My face<br>
        was purple, my lips blue, my faculties suspended.  I neither saw nor<br>
        heard.  All notion of time had gone from my mind.  My muscles could not<br>
        contract.  I do not know how many hours passed thus, but I was<br>
        conscious of the agony that was coming over me.  I felt as if I was<br>
        going to die.  Suddenly I came to.  Some breaths of air penetrated my<br>
        lungs.  Had we risen to the surface of the waves?  Were we free of the<br>
        iceberg?  No!  Ned and Conseil, my two brave friends, were sacrificing<br>
        themselves to save me.  Some particles of air still remained at the<br>
        bottom of one apparatus.  Instead of using it, they had kept it for me,<br>
        and, while they were being suffocated, they gave me life, drop by drop.<br>
        I wanted to push back the thing; they held my hands, and for some<br>
        moments I breathed freely.  I looked at the clock; it was eleven in the<br>
        morning.  It ought to be the 28th of March.  The Nautilus went at a<br>
        frightful pace, forty miles an hour.  It literally tore through the<br>
        water.  Where was Captain Nemo?  Had he succumbed?  Were his companions<br>
        dead with him?  At the moment the manometer indicated that we were not<br>
        more than twenty feet from the surface.  A mere plate of ice separated<br>
        us from the atmosphere.  Could we not break it?  Perhaps.  In any case<br>
        the Nautilus was going to attempt it.  I felt that it was in an oblique<br>
        position, lowering the stern, and raising the bows.  The introduction<br>
        of water had been the means of disturbing its equilibrium.  Then,<br>
        impelled by its powerful screw, it attacked the ice-field from beneath<br>
        like a formidable battering-ram.  It broke it by backing and then<br>
        rushing forward against the field, which gradually gave way; and at<br>
        last, dashing suddenly against it, shot forwards on the ice-field, that<br>
        crushed beneath its weight.  The panel was opened--one might say torn<br>
        off--and the pure air came in in abundance to all parts of the Nautilus.<br>
        <br>
        <br>

        CHAPTER XVII<br>
        <br>
        FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON<br>
        <br>
        How I got on to the platform, I have no idea; perhaps the Canadian had<br>
        carried me there.  But I breathed, I inhaled the vivifying sea-air.  My<br>
        two companions were getting drunk with the fresh particles.  The other<br>
        unhappy men had been so long without food, that they could not with<br>
        impunity indulge in the simplest aliments that were given them.  We, on<br>
        the contrary, had no end to restrain ourselves; we could draw this air<br>
        freely into our lungs, and it was the breeze, the breeze alone, that<br>
        filled us with this keen enjoyment.<br>
        <br>
        "Ah!" said Conseil, "how delightful this oxygen is!  Master need not<br>
        fear to breathe it.  There is enough for everybody."<br>
        <br>
        Ned Land did not speak, but he opened his jaws wide enough to frighten<br>
        a shark.  Our strength soon returned, and, when I looked round me, I<br>
        saw we were alone on the platform.  The foreign seamen in the Nautilus<br>
        were contented with the air that circulated in the interior; none of<br>
        them had come to drink in the open air.<br>
        <br>
        The first words I spoke were words of gratitude and thankfulness to my<br>
        two companions.  Ned and Conseil had prolonged my life during the last<br>
        hours of this long agony.  All my gratitude could not repay such<br>
        devotion.<br>
        <br>
        "My friends," said I, "we are bound one to the other for ever, and I am<br>
        under infinite obligations to you."<br>
        <br>
        "Which I shall take advantage of," exclaimed the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "What do you mean?" said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "I mean that I shall take you with me when I leave this infernal<br>
        Nautilus."<br>
        <br>
        "Well," said Conseil, "after all this, are we going right?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," I replied, "for we are going the way of the sun, and here the<br>
        sun is in the north."<br>
        <br>
        "No doubt," said Ned Land; "but it remains to be seen whether he will<br>
        bring the ship into the Pacific or the Atlantic Ocean, that is, into<br>
        frequented or deserted seas."<br>
        <br>
        I could not answer that question, and I feared that Captain Nemo would<br>
        rather take us to the vast ocean that touches the coasts of Asia and<br>
        America at the same time.  He would thus complete the tour round the<br>
        submarine world, and return to those waters in which the Nautilus could<br>
        sail freely.  We ought, before long, to settle this important point.<br>
        The Nautilus went at a rapid pace.  The polar circle was soon passed,<br>
        and the course shaped for Cape Horn.  We were off the American point,<br>
        March 31st, at seven o'clock in the evening.  Then all our past<br>
        sufferings were forgotten.  The remembrance of that imprisonment in the<br>
        ice was effaced from our minds.  We only thought of the future.<br>
        Captain Nemo did not appear again either in the drawing-room or on the<br>
        platform.  The point shown each day on the planisphere, and, marked by<br>
        the lieutenant, showed me the exact direction of the Nautilus.  Now, on<br>
        that evening, it was evident, to, my great satisfaction, that we were<br>
        going back to the North by the Atlantic.  The next day, April 1st, when<br>
        the Nautilus ascended to the surface some minutes before noon, we<br>
        sighted land to the west.  It was Terra del Fuego, which the first<br>
        navigators named thus from seeing the quantity of smoke that rose from<br>
        the natives' huts.  The coast seemed low to me, but in the distance<br>
        rose high mountains.  I even thought I had a glimpse of Mount<br>
        Sarmiento, that rises 2,070 yards above the level of the sea, with a<br>
        very pointed summit, which, according as it is misty or clear, is a<br>
        sign of fine or of wet weather.  At this moment the peak was clearly<br>
        defined against the sky.  The Nautilus, diving again under the water,<br>
        approached the coast, which was only some few miles off.  From the<br>
        glass windows in the drawing-room, I saw long seaweeds and gigantic<br>
        fuci and varech, of which the open polar sea contains so many<br>
        specimens, with their sharp polished filaments; they measured about 300<br>
        yards in length--real cables, thicker than one's thumb; and, having<br>
        great tenacity, they are often used as ropes for vessels.  Another weed<br>
        known as velp, with leaves four feet long, buried in the coral<br>
        concretions, hung at the bottom.  It served as nest and food for<br>
        myriads of crustacea and molluscs, crabs, and cuttlefish.  There seals<br>
        and otters had splendid repasts, eating the flesh of fish with<br>
        sea-vegetables, according to the English fashion.  Over this fertile<br>
        and luxuriant ground the Nautilus passed with great rapidity.  Towards<br>
        evening it approached the Falkland group, the rough summits of which I<br>
        recognised the following day.  The depth of the sea was moderate.  On<br>
        the shores our nets brought in beautiful specimens of sea weed, and<br>
        particularly a certain fucus, the roots of which were filled with the<br>
        best mussels in the world.  Geese and ducks fell by dozens on the<br>
        platform, and soon took their places in the pantry on board.<br>
        <br>
        When the last heights of the Falklands had disappeared from the<br>
        horizon, the Nautilus sank to between twenty and twenty-five yards, and<br>
        followed the American coast.  Captain Nemo did not show himself.  Until<br>
        the 3rd of April we did not quit the shores of Patagonia, sometimes<br>
        under the ocean, sometimes at the surface.  The Nautilus passed beyond<br>
        the large estuary formed by the Uraguay.  Its direction was northwards,<br>
        and followed the long windings of the coast of South America.  We had<br>
        then made 1,600 miles since our embarkation in the seas of Japan.<br>
        About eleven o'clock in the morning the Tropic of Capricorn was crossed<br>
        on the thirty-seventh meridian, and we passed Cape Frio standing out to<br>
        sea.  Captain Nemo, to Ned Land's great displeasure, did not like the<br>
        neighbourhood of the inhabited coasts of Brazil, for we went at a giddy<br>
        speed.  Not a fish, not a bird of the swiftest kind could follow us,<br>
        and the natural curiosities of these seas escaped all observation.<br>
        <br>
        This speed was kept up for several days, and in the evening of the 9th<br>
        of April we sighted the most westerly point of South America that forms<br>
        Cape San Roque.  But then the Nautilus swerved again, and sought the<br>
        lowest depth of a submarine valley which is between this Cape and<br>
        Sierra Leone on the African coast.  This valley bifurcates to the<br>
        parallel of the Antilles, and terminates at the mouth by the enormous<br>
        depression of 9,000 yards.  In this place, the geological basin of the<br>
        ocean forms, as far as the Lesser Antilles, a cliff to three and a half<br>
        miles perpendicular in height, and, at the parallel of the Cape Verde<br>
        Islands, an other wall not less considerable, that encloses thus all<br>
        the sunk continent of the Atlantic.  The bottom of this immense valley<br>
        is dotted with some mountains, that give to these submarine places a<br>
        picturesque aspect.  I speak, moreover, from the manuscript charts that<br>
        were in the library of the Nautilus--charts evidently due to Captain<br>
        Nemo's hand, and made after his personal observations.  For two days<br>
        the desert and deep waters were visited by means of the inclined<br>
        planes.  The Nautilus was furnished with long diagonal broadsides which<br>
        carried it to all elevations.  But on the 11th of April it rose<br>
        suddenly, and land appeared at the mouth of the Amazon River, a vast<br>
        estuary, the embouchure of which is so considerable that it freshens<br>
        the sea-water for the distance of several leagues.<br>
        <br>
        The equator was crossed. Twenty miles to the west were the Guianas, a<br>
        French territory, on which we could have found an easy refuge; but a<br>
        stiff breeze was blowing, and the furious waves would not have allowed<br>
        a single boat to face them. Ned Land understood that, no doubt, for he<br>
        spoke not a word about it. For my part, I made no allusion to his<br>
        schemes of flight, for I would not urge him to make an attempt that<br>
        must inevitably fail. I made the time pass pleasantly by interesting<br>
        studies.  During the days of April 11th and 12th, the Nautilus did not<br>
        leave the surface of the sea, and the net brought in a marvellous haul<br>
        of Zoophytes, fish and reptiles. Some zoophytes had been fished up by<br>
        the chain of the nets; they were for the most part beautiful<br>
        phyctallines, belonging to the actinidian family, and among other<br>
        species the phyctalis protexta, peculiar to that part of the ocean,<br>
        with a little cylindrical trunk, ornamented With vertical lines,<br>
        speckled with red dots, crowning a marvellous blossoming of tentacles.<br>
        As to the molluscs, they consisted of some I had already<br>
        observed--turritellas, olive porphyras, with regular lines<br>
        intercrossed, with red spots standing out plainly against the flesh;<br>
        odd pteroceras, like petrified scorpions; translucid hyaleas,<br>
        argonauts, cuttle-fish (excellent eating), and certain species of<br>
        calmars that naturalists of antiquity have classed amongst the<br>
        flying-fish, and that serve principally for bait for cod-fishing. I had<br>
        now an opportunity of studying several species of fish on these shores.<br>
        Amongst the cartilaginous ones, petromyzons-pricka, a sort of eel,<br>
        fifteen inches long, with a greenish head, violet fins, grey-blue back,<br>
        brown belly, silvered and sown with bright spots, the pupil of the eye<br>
        encircled with gold--a curious animal, that the current of the Amazon<br>
        had drawn to the sea, for they inhabit fresh waters--tuberculated<br>
        streaks, with pointed snouts, and a long loose tail, armed with a long<br>
        jagged sting; little sharks, a yard long, grey and whitish skin, and<br>
        several rows of teeth, bent back, that are generally known by the name<br>
        of pantouffles; vespertilios, a kind of red isosceles triangle, half a<br>
        yard long, to which pectorals are attached by fleshy prolongations that<br>
        make them look like bats, but that their horny appendage, situated near<br>
        the nostrils, has given them the name of sea-unicorns; lastly, some<br>
        species of balistae, the curassavian, whose spots were of a brilliant<br>
        gold colour, and the capriscus of clear violet, and with varying shades<br>
        like a pigeon's throat.<br>
        <br>
        I end here this catalogue, which is somewhat dry perhaps, but very<br>
        exact, with a series of bony fish that I observed in passing belonging<br>
        to the apteronotes, and whose snout is white as snow, the body of a<br>
        beautiful black, marked with a very long loose fleshy strip;<br>
        odontognathes, armed with spikes; sardines nine inches long, glittering<br>
        with a bright silver light; a species of mackerel provided with two<br>
        anal fins; centronotes of a blackish tint, that are fished for with<br>
        torches, long fish, two yards in length, with fat flesh, white and<br>
        firm, which, when they arc fresh, taste like eel, and when dry, like<br>
        smoked salmon; labres, half red, covered with scales only at the bottom<br>
        of the dorsal and anal fins; chrysoptera, on which gold and silver<br>
        blend their brightness with that of the ruby and topaz; golden-tailed<br>
        spares, the flesh of which is extremely delicate, and whose<br>
        phosphorescent properties betray them in the midst of the waters;<br>
        orange-coloured spares with long tongues; maigres, with gold caudal<br>
        fins, dark thorn-tails, anableps of Surinam, etc.<br>
        <br>
        Notwithstanding this "et cetera," I must not omit to mention fish that<br>
        Conseil will long remember, and with good reason. One of our nets had<br>
        hauled up a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off,<br>
        formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces. It was white<br>
        underneath, red above, with large round spots of dark blue encircled<br>
        with black, very glossy skin, terminating in a bilobed fin. Laid out on<br>
        the platform, it struggled, tried to turn itself by convulsive<br>
        movements, and made so many efforts, that one last turn had nearly sent<br>
        it into the sea. But Conseil, not wishing to let the fish go, rushed to<br>
        <a href=../site0/page0_9064.html>internal_link4_text</a><br><br>
        it, and, before I could prevent him, had seized it with both hands. In<br>
        a moment he was overthrown, his legs in the air, and half his body<br>
        paralysed, crying--<br>
        <br>
        "Oh! master, master! help me!"<br>
        <br>
        It was the first time the poor boy had spoken to me so familiarly.  The<br>
        Canadian and I took him up, and rubbed his contracted arms till he<br>
        became sensible. The unfortunate Conseil had attacked a cramp-fish of<br>
        the most dangerous kind, the cumana. This odd animal, in a medium<br>
        conductor like water, strikes fish at several yards' distance, so great<br>
        is the power of its electric organ, the two principal surfaces of which<br>
        do not measure less than twenty-seven square feet. The next day, April<br>
        12th, the Nautilus approached the Dutch coast, near the mouth of the<br>
        Maroni. There several groups of sea-cows herded together; they were<br>
        manatees, that, like the dugong and the stellera, belong to the skenian<br>
        order. These beautiful animals, peaceable and inoffensive, from<br>
        eighteen to twenty-one feet in length, weigh at least sixteen<br>
        hundredweight. I told Ned Land and Conseil that provident nature had<br>
        assigned an important role to these mammalia. Indeed, they, like the<br>
        seals, are designed to graze on the submarine prairies, and thus<br>
        destroy the accumulation of weed that obstructs the tropical rivers.<br>
        <br>
        "And do you know," I added, "what has been the result since men have<br>
        almost entirely annihilated this useful race? That the putrefied weeds<br>
        have poisoned the air, and the poisoned air causes the yellow fever,<br>
        that desolates these beautiful countries. Enormous vegetations are<br>
        multiplied under the torrid seas, and the evil is irresistibly<br>
        developed from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata to Florida. If we are<br>
        to believe Toussenel, this plague is nothing to what it would be if the<br>
        seas were cleaned of whales and seals. Then, infested with poulps,<br>
        medusae, and cuttle-fish, they would become immense centres of<br>
        infection, since their waves would not possess 'these vast stomachs<br>
        that God had charged to infest the surface of the seas.'"<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHAPTER XVIII<br>
        <br>
        THE POULPS<br>
        <br>
        For several days the Nautilus kept off from the American coast.<br>
        Evidently it did not wish to risk the tides of the Gulf of Mexico or of<br>
        the sea of the Antilles.  April 16th, we sighted Martinique and<br>
        Guadaloupe from a distance of about thirty miles.  I saw their tall<br>
        peaks for an instant.  The Canadian, who counted on carrying out his<br>
        projects in the Gulf, by either landing or hailing one of the numerous<br>
        boats that coast from one island to another, was quite disheartened.<br>
        Flight would have been quite practicable, if Ned Land had been able to<br>
        take possession of the boat without the Captain's knowledge.  But in<br>
        the open sea it could not be thought of.  The Canadian, Conseil, and I<br>
        had a long conversation on this subject.  For six months we had been<br>
        prisoners on board the Nautilus.  We had travelled 17,000 leagues; and,<br>
        as Ned Land said, there was no reason why it should come to an end.  We<br>
        could hope nothing from the Captain of the Nautilus, but only from<br>
        ourselves.  Besides, for some time past he had become graver, more<br>
        retired, less sociable.  He seemed to shun me.  I met him rarely.<br>
        Formerly he was pleased to explain the submarine marvels to me; now he<br>
        left me to my studies, and came no more to the saloon.  What change had<br>
        come over him?  For what cause?  For my part, I did not wish to bury<br>
        with me my curious and novel studies.  I had now the power to write the<br>
        true book of the sea; and this book, sooner or later, I wished to see<br>
        daylight.  The land nearest us was the archipelago of the Bahamas.<br>
        There rose high submarine cliffs covered with large weeds.  It was<br>
        about eleven o'clock when Ned Land drew my attention to a formidable<br>
        pricking, like the sting of an ant, which was produced by means of<br>
        large seaweeds.<br>
        <br>
        "Well," I said, "these are proper caverns for poulps, and I should not<br>
        be astonished to see some of these monsters."<br>
        <br>
        "What!" said Conseil; "cuttlefish, real cuttlefish of the cephalopod<br>
        class?"<br>
        <br>
        "No," I said, "poulps of huge dimensions."<br>
        <br>
        "I will never believe that such animals exist," said Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "Well," said Conseil, with the most serious air in the world, "I<br>
        remember perfectly to have seen a large vessel drawn under the waves by<br>
        an octopus's arm."<br>
        <br>
        "You saw that?" said the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Ned."<br>
        <br>
        "With your own eyes?"<br>
        <br>
        "With my own eyes."<br>
        <br>
        "Where, pray, might that be?"<br>
        <br>
        "At St. Malo," answered Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "In the port?" said Ned, ironically.<br>
        <br>
        "No; in a church," replied Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "In a church!" cried the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes; friend Ned.  In a picture representing the poulp in question."<br>
        <br>
        "Good!" said Ned Land, bursting out laughing.<br>
        <br>
        "He is quite right," I said.  "I have heard of this picture; but the<br>
        subject represented is taken from a legend, and you know what to think<br>
        of legends in the matter of natural history.  Besides, when it is a<br>
        question of monsters, the imagination is apt to run wild.  Not only is<br>
        it supposed that these poulps can draw down vessels, but a certain<br>
        Olaus Magnus speaks of an octopus a mile long that is more like an<br>
        island than an animal.  It is also said that the Bishop of Nidros was<br>
        building an altar on an immense rock.  Mass finished, the rock began to<br>
        walk, and returned to the sea.  The rock was a poulp.  Another Bishop,<br>
        Pontoppidan, speaks also of a poulp on which a regiment of cavalry<br>
        could manoeuvre.  Lastly, the ancient naturalists speak of monsters<br>
        whose mouths were like gulfs, and which were too large to pass through<br>
        the Straits of Gibraltar."<br>
        <br>
        "But how much is true of these stories?" asked Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "Nothing, my friends; at least of that which passes the limit of truth<br>
        to get to fable or legend.  Nevertheless, there must be some ground for<br>
        the imagination of the story-tellers. One cannot deny that poulps and<br>
        cuttlefish exist of a large species, inferior, however, to the<br>
        cetaceans.  Aristotle has stated the dimensions of a cuttlefish as five<br>
        cubits, or nine feet two inches.  Our fishermen frequently see some<br>
        that are more than four feet long.  Some skeletons of poulps are<br>
        preserved in the museums of Trieste and Montpelier, that measure two<br>
        yards in length.  Besides, according to the calculations of some<br>
        naturalists, one of these animals only six feet long would have<br>
        tentacles twenty-seven feet long.  That would suffice to make a<br>
        formidable monster."<br>
        <br>
        "Do they fish for them in these days?" asked Ned.<br>
        <br>
        "If they do not fish for them, sailors see them at least.  One of my<br>
        friends, Captain Paul Bos of Havre, has often affirmed that he met one<br>
        of these monsters of colossal dimensions in the Indian seas.  But the<br>
        most astonishing fact, and which does not permit of the denial of the<br>
        existence of these gigantic animals, happened some years ago, in 1861."<br>
        <br>
        "What is the fact?" asked Ned Land.<br>
        <br>
        "This is it.  In 1861, to the north-east of Teneriffe, very nearly in<br>
        the same latitude we are in now, the crew of the despatch-boat Alector<br>
        perceived a monstrous cuttlefish swimming in the waters.  Captain<br>
        Bouguer went near to the animal, and attacked it with harpoon and guns,<br>
        without much success, for balls and harpoons glided over the soft<br>
        flesh.  After several fruitless attempts the crew tried to pass a<br>
        slip-knot round the body of the mollusc.  The noose slipped as far as<br>
        the tail fins and there stopped.  They tried then to haul it on board,<br>
        but its weight was so considerable that the tightness of the cord<br>
        separated the tail from the body, and, deprived of this ornament, he<br>
        disappeared under the water."<br>
        <br>
        "Indeed! is that a fact?"<br>
        <br>
        "An indisputable fact, my good Ned.  They proposed to name this poulp<br>
        `Bouguer's cuttlefish.'"<br>
        <br>
        "What length was it?" asked the Canadian.<br>
        <br>
        "Did it not measure about six yards?" said Conseil, who, posted at the<br>
        window, was examining again the irregular windings of the cliff.<br>
        <br>
        "Precisely," I replied.<br>
        <br>
        "Its head," rejoined Conseil, "was it not crowned with eight tentacles,<br>
        that beat the water like a nest of serpents?"<br>
        <br>
        "Precisely."<br>
        <br>
        "Had not its eyes, placed at the back of its head, considerable<br>
        development?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, Conseil."<br>
        <br>
        "And was not its mouth like a parrot's beak?"<br>
        <br>
        "Exactly, Conseil."<br>
        <br>
        "Very well! no offence to master," he replied, quietly; "if this is not<br>
        Bouguer's cuttlefish, it is, at least, one of its brothers."<br>
        <br>
        I looked at Conseil.  Ned Land hurried to the window.<br>
        <br>
        "What a horrible beast!" he cried.<br>
        <br>
        I looked in my turn, and could not repress a gesture of disgust.<br>
        Before my eyes was a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends<br>
        of the marvellous.  It was an immense cuttlefish, being eight yards<br>
        long.  It swam crossways in the direction of the Nautilus with great<br>
        speed, watching us with its enormous staring green eyes.  Its eight<br>
        arms, or rather feet, fixed to its head, that have given the name of<br>
        cephalopod to these animals, were twice as long as its body, and were<br>
        twisted like the furies' hair.  One could see the 250 air holes on the<br>
        inner side of the tentacles.  The monster's mouth, a horned beak like a<br>
        parrot's, opened and shut vertically.  Its tongue, a horned substance,<br>
        furnished with several rows of pointed teeth, came out quivering from<br>
        this veritable pair of shears.  What a freak of nature, a bird's beak<br>
        on a mollusc!  Its spindle-like body formed a fleshy mass that might<br>
        weigh 4,000 to 5,000 lb.; the, varying colour changing with great<br>
        rapidity, according to the irritation of the animal, passed<br>
        successively from livid grey to reddish brown.  What irritated this<br>
        mollusc?  No doubt the presence of the Nautilus, more formidable than<br>
        itself, and on which its suckers or its jaws had no hold.  Yet, what<br>
        monsters these poulps are! what vitality the Creator has given them!<br>
        what vigour in their movements! and they possess three hearts!  Chance<br>
        had brought us in presence of this cuttlefish, and I did not wish to<br>
        lose the opportunity of carefully studying this specimen of<br>
        cephalopods.  I overcame the horror that inspired me, and, taking a<br>
        pencil, began to draw it.<br>
        <br>
        "Perhaps this is the same which the Alector saw," said Conseil.<br>
        <br>
        "No," replied the Canadian; "for this is whole, and the other had lost<br>
        its tail."<br>
        <br>
        "That is no reason," I replied.  "The arms and tails of these animals<br>
        are re-formed by renewal; and in seven years the tail of Bouguer's<br>
        cuttlefish has no doubt had time to grow."<br>
        <br>
        By this time other poulps appeared at the port light.  I counted seven.<br>
        They formed a procession after the Nautilus, and I heard their beaks<br>
        gnashing against the iron hull.  I continued my work.  These monsters<br>
        kept in the water with such precision that they seemed immovable.<br>
        Suddenly the Nautilus stopped.  A shock made it tremble in every plate.<br>
        <br>
        "Have we struck anything?"  I asked.<br>
        <br>
        "In any case," replied the Canadian, "we shall be free, for we are<br>
        floating."<br>
        <br>
        The Nautilus was floating, no doubt, but it did not move.  A minute<br>
        passed.  Captain Nemo, followed by his lieutenant, entered the<br>
        drawing-room. I had not seen him for some time.  He seemed dull.<br>
        Without noticing or speaking to us, he went to the panel, looked at the<br>
        poulps, and said something to his lieutenant.  The latter went out.<br>
        Soon the panels were shut.  The ceiling was lighted.  I went towards<br>
        the Captain.<br>
        <br>
        "A curious collection of poulps?"  I said.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, indeed, Mr. Naturalist," he replied; "and we are going to fight<br>
        them, man to beast."<br>
        <br>
        I looked at him.  I thought I had not heard aright.<br>
        <br>
        "Man to beast?"  I repeated.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, sir.  The screw is stopped.  I think that the horny jaws of one<br>
        of the cuttlefish is entangled in the blades.  That is what prevents<br>
        our moving."<br>
        <br>
        "What are you going to do?"<br>
        <br>
        "Rise to the surface, and slaughter this vermin."<br>
        <br>
        "A difficult enterprise."<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, indeed.  The electric bullets are powerless against the soft<br>
        flesh, where they do not find resistance enough to go off.  But we<br>
        shall attack them with the hatchet."<br>
        <br>
        "And the harpoon, sir," said the Canadian, "if you do not refuse my<br>
        help."<br>
        <br>
        "I will accept it, Master Land."<br>
        <br>
        "We will follow you," I said, and, following Captain Nemo, we went<br>
        towards the central staircase.<br>
        <br>
        There, about ten men with boarding-hatchets were ready for the attack.<br>
        Conseil and I took two hatchets; Ned Land seized a harpoon.  The<br>
        Nautilus had then risen to the surface.  One of the sailors, posted on<br>
        the top ladderstep, unscrewed the bolts of the panels.  But hardly were<br>
        the screws loosed, when the panel rose with great violence, evidently<br>
        drawn by the suckers of a poulp's arm.  Immediately one of these arms<br>
        slid like a serpent down the opening and twenty others were above.<br>
        With one blow of the axe, Captain Nemo cut this formidable tentacle,<br>
        that slid wriggling down the ladder.  Just as we were pressing one on<br>
        the other to reach the platform, two other arms, lashing the air, came<br>
        down on the seaman placed before Captain Nemo, and lifted him up with<br>
        irresistible power.  Captain Nemo uttered a cry, and rushed out.  We<br>
        hurried after him.<br>
        <br>
        What a scene!  The unhappy man, seized by the tentacle and fixed to the<br>
        suckers, was balanced in the air at the caprice of this enormous trunk.<br>
        He rattled in his throat, he was stifled, he cried, "Help! help!"<br>
        These words, spoken in French, startled me!  I had a fellow-countryman<br>
        on board, perhaps several!  That heart-rending cry!  I shall hear it<br>
        all my life.  The unfortunate man was lost.  Who could rescue him from<br>
        that powerful pressure?  However, Captain Nemo had rushed to the poulp,<br>
        and with one blow of the axe had cut through one arm.  His lieutenant<br>
        struggled furiously against other monsters that crept on the flanks of<br>
        the Nautilus.  The crew fought with their axes.  The Canadian, Conseil,<br>
        and I buried our weapons in the fleshy masses; a strong smell of musk<br>
        penetrated the atmosphere.  It was horrible!<br>
        <br>
        For one instant, I thought the unhappy man, entangled with the poulp,<br>
        would be torn from its powerful suction.  Seven of the eight arms had<br>
        been cut off.  One only wriggled in the air, brandishing the victim<br>
        like a feather.  But just as Captain Nemo and his lieutenant threw<br>
        themselves on it, the animal ejected a stream of black liquid.  We were<br>
        blinded with it.  When the cloud dispersed, the cuttlefish had<br>
        disappeared, and my unfortunate countryman with it.  Ten or twelve<br>
        poulps now invaded the platform and sides of the Nautilus.  We rolled<br>
        pell-mell into the midst of this nest of serpents, that wriggled on the<br>
        platform in the waves of blood and ink.  It seemed as though these<br>
        slimy tentacles sprang up like the hydra's heads.  Ned Land's harpoon,<br>
        at each stroke, was plunged into the staring eyes of the cuttle fish.<br>
